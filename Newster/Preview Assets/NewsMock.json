But next year, they say, really might be different. A strong crop of first-time offerings since September, most of which are trading well, coupled with a number of large companies looking to list next year and rising stock markets, is giving IPO bankers confidence of a return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026.

Europe's IPO Bankers See a Revival Next Year, for Real This Time Back to video There’s been a prolonged shortage of IPOs in Europe since 2021, which was a bumper year for first-time offerings. In the years that followed there has been sporadic activity, but the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, soaring energy prices, conflict in the Middle East, domestic political chaos, tariffs and trade wars created the sort of uncertainty that makes an IPO hard to pull off. Those fears are starting to ease and bankers looking ahead to next year say the outlook seems clear. Top Stories Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

Core to this change were the companies going public in September and October. Home security company Verisure Plc launched the region’s largest IPO since 2022, joined by consumer lender Noba Bank Group AB and prosthetics maker Ottobock SE. They led a rebound in issuance volume and traded higher than their IPO price in the weeks that followed. “I do think the post-summer class of IPOs has marked a bit of a turning point,” said Lawrence Jamieson, co-head of EMEA ECM at Barclays Plc. “It certainly feels the backdrop for the European IPO market is the most constructive it has been since the start of the Ukraine war.” All told, EMEA exchanges have raised more than $21 billion through IPOs so far this year, coming back from a first half disrupted by US tariffs, but still 34% less than in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s in contrast to exchanges in the US and the rest of Asia that raised more from IPOs than last year. “Next year should be much stronger,” said Ashish Jhajharia, head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s ECM syndicate in EMEA. “There is a lot more visibility on the actionable pipeline than a year ago.” Arms maker Czechoslovak Group AS has been gearing up for a potential IPO in Amsterdam as soon as the first quarter of next year at a valuation as high as €30 billion ($34.5 billion). Software company Visma AS, last valued at €19 billion in 2023, is considering going public in London in the first half of 2026, Bloomberg News reported. There are more multibillion-dollar IPOs in the works. Franco-German tankmaker KNDS NV and lift manufacturer TK Elevator GmbH have appointed financial advisers to help them prepare for a public offering sometime next year, Bloomberg News has reported. Some companies that put off going public in 2025, are now revisiting plans to go public, dealmakers say. “I would agree that Europe’s IPO market is the strongest it’s been in a few years, given the cadence of request for proposals and mandates that we see and the companies we know are likely to IPO in the next 12 to 24 months,” said Ed Sankey, who oversees Citigroup Inc.’s equity underwriting business across EMEA and Asia-Pacific. That’s not to say there aren’t risks ahead. “As always there is a chance that macro events, policy or geopolitical tensions or a correction can cause an increase in volatility and impact that ability to execute the pipeline,” he said. Equity markets have been jittery in the last few weeks on fears that valuations of stocks linked to artificial-intelligence spending are looking stretched. With that backdrop, some equity capital markets bankers are advising companies to tap markets while the iron is still hot. “The rational thing to do from an ECM perspective is to try to get business done as quickly as you can,” Andreas Bernstorff, global head of ECM at BNP Paribas SA, said. “If anything, people have been pulling their timelines forward to take advantage of what looks like a market that will be risk-on for the next six months or so.” Europe’s benchmark indexes, including the Stoxx 600, the UK’s FTSE 100, France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX have hit record highs this year. That helps encourage issuers to the market, although ironically it could also risk dashing sentiment if markets start drifting lower from the peaks. “The uncomfortable part of this IPO cycle is that it started with equity markets at or near all-time highs,” said Gareth McCartney, global head of capital markets origination at UBS Group AG. While this poses a risk, the breadth of sectors represented in Europe’s IPO pipeline should make it more sustainable, featuring key investment themes like defense, infrastructure and financials, he said. In fact, trading in Europe’s latest cohort of IPOs has even outshone firms that went public around the US government shutdown. “They’ve traded on par if not better than IPOs in the US,” Goldman Sachs’ Cormack said. “That’s a big tick in the box.” —With assistance from Swetha Gopinath.",

In the years that followed there has been sporadic activity, but the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, soaring energy prices, conflict in the Middle East, domestic political chaos, tariffs and trade wars created the sort of uncertainty that makes an IPO hard to pull off.

Core to this change were the companies going public in September and October. Home security company Verisure Plc launched the region’s largest IPO since 2022, joined by consumer lender Noba Bank Group AB and prosthetics maker Ottobock SE. They led a rebound in issuance volume and traded higher than their IPO price in the weeks that followed. “I do think the post-summer class of IPOs has marked a bit of a turning point,” said Lawrence Jamieson, co-head of EMEA ECM at Barclays Plc. “It certainly feels the backdrop for the European IPO market is the most constructive it has been since the start of the Ukraine war.” All told, EMEA exchanges have raised more than $21 billion through IPOs so far this year, coming back from a first half disrupted by US tariffs, but still 34% less than in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s in contrast to exchanges in the US and the rest of Asia that raised more from IPOs than last year. “Next year should be much stronger,” said Ashish Jhajharia, head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s ECM syndicate in EMEA. “There is a lot more visibility on the actionable pipeline than a year ago.” Arms maker Czechoslovak Group AS has been gearing up for a potential IPO in Amsterdam as soon as the first quarter of next year at a valuation as high as €30 billion ($34.5 billion). Software company Visma AS, last valued at €19 billion in 2023, is considering going public in London in the first half of 2026, Bloomberg News reported. There are more multibillion-dollar IPOs in the works. Franco-German tankmaker KNDS NV and lift manufacturer TK Elevator GmbH have appointed financial advisers to help them prepare for a public offering sometime next year, Bloomberg News has reported. Some companies that put off going public in 2025, are now revisiting plans to go public, dealmakers say. “I would agree that Europe’s IPO market is the strongest it’s been in a few years, given the cadence of request for proposals and mandates that we see and the companies we know are likely to IPO in the next 12 to 24 months,” said Ed Sankey, who oversees Citigroup Inc.’s equity underwriting business across EMEA and Asia-Pacific. That’s not to say there aren’t risks ahead. “As always there is a chance that macro events, policy or geopolitical tensions or a correction can cause an increase in volatility and impact that ability to execute the pipeline,” he said.

With that backdrop, some equity capital markets bankers are advising companies to tap markets while the iron is still hot. “The rational thing to do from an ECM perspective is to try to get business done as quickly as you can,” Andreas Bernstorff, global head of ECM at BNP Paribas SA, said. “If anything, people have been pulling their timelines forward to take advantage of what looks like a market that will be risk-on for the next six months or so.” Europe’s benchmark indexes, including the Stoxx 600, the UK’s FTSE 100, France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX have hit record highs this year.

While this poses a risk, the breadth of sectors represented in Europe’s IPO pipeline should make it more sustainable, featuring key investment themes like defense, infrastructure and financials, he said. In fact, trading in Europe’s latest cohort of IPOs has even outshone firms that went public around the US government shutdown. “They’ve traded on par if not better than IPOs in the US,” Goldman Sachs’ Cormack said. “That’s a big tick in the box.” —With assistance from Swetha Gopinath.",
