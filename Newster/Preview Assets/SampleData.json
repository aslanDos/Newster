      "content": "India's seafood sector is strategically expanding its global market reach, reducing its traditional reliance on the United States by diversifying exports to offset rising tariffs under the Trump administration . Shrimp exports grew strongly in the first five months of fiscal year 2026, supported by robust demand from non-US destinations, including Vietnam, Belgium, China and Russia, according to CareEdge Ratings . Export value rose 18% year-on-year to $2.43 billion, driven by a 11% increase in shipment volumes to 3.48 lakh metric tonnes (LMT). The report said that “India's seafood sector is gradually broadening its market presence beyond traditional markets like the USA,” ANI reported. Non-US markets account for bulk of growth Non-US markets accounted for a significant 86% of the incremental export value, with shipments to these destinations surging 30% year-on-year to $1.38 billion during the first five months of FY26 (5MFY26), up from $1.06 billion a year earlier. Their share in total shrimp exports increased from 51% in 5MFY25 to 57% in 5MFY26. This strategic expansion by Indian exporters into newer and previously less accessible global markets has helped cushion the pressure emerging from the challenging US market. US tariffs and competitive disadvantage Indian shrimp exports to the US have faced sharply higher tariffs since the early part of FY26, averaging around 18% between April and August 2025, compared to 13%-14% for competitors like Ecuador and Indonesia. After August, effective duties on Indian shrimp surged to nearly 58%, while competing nations faced tariffs between 18-49%. Key non-US markets and their role in India's growth Several non-US destinations have shown notable increases in demand for Indian seafood. — China remained the largest buyer, with exports rising 16%. — Japan, which earlier functioned as a reprocessing market, maintained stable export levels. — Vietnam strengthened its role as a re-export hub, with exports doubling to $0.18 billion. — Belgium exports also doubled to $0.14 billion, driven by better demand from the European Union and stronger compliance with traceability requirements by Indian exporters. Outlook for the sector CareEdge warned that momentum may soften in the second half of FY26 due to US market pressures and weaker fresh orders. However, the industry is expected to find support through efforts to open access to new markets and increased approvals for Indian units exporting to the EU and Russia, ANI reported.",

      "description": "Bankers’ forecasts of an upcoming revival in European initial public offerings haven’t always stood the test of time. But next year, they say, really might be different.",
      "content": "(Bloomberg) — Bankers’ forecasts of an upcoming revival in European initial public offerings haven’t always stood the test of time. But next year, they say, really might be different. A strong crop of first-time offerings since September, most of which are trading well, coupled with a number of large companies looking to list next year and rising stock markets, is giving IPO bankers confidence of a return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team . Europe's IPO Bankers See a Revival Next Year, for Real This Time Back to video There’s been a prolonged shortage of IPOs in Europe since 2021, which was a bumper year for first-time offerings. In the years that followed there has been sporadic activity, but the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, soaring energy prices, conflict in the Middle East, domestic political chaos, tariffs and trade wars created the sort of uncertainty that makes an IPO hard to pull off. Those fears are starting to ease and bankers looking ahead to next year say the outlook seems clear. Top Stories Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

Core to this change were the companies going public in September and October. Home security company Verisure Plc launched the region’s largest IPO since 2022, joined by consumer lender Noba Bank Group AB and prosthetics maker Ottobock SE. They led a rebound in issuance volume and traded higher than their IPO price in the weeks that followed. “I do think the post-summer class of IPOs has marked a bit of a turning point,” said Lawrence Jamieson, co-head of EMEA ECM at Barclays Plc. “It certainly feels the backdrop for the European IPO market is the most constructive it has been since the start of the Ukraine war.” All told, EMEA exchanges have raised more than $21 billion through IPOs so far this year, coming back from a first half disrupted by US tariffs, but still 34% less than in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s in contrast to exchanges in the US and the rest of Asia that raised more from IPOs than last year. “Next year should be much stronger,” said Ashish Jhajharia, head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s ECM syndicate in EMEA. “There is a lot more visibility on the actionable pipeline than a year ago.” Arms maker Czechoslovak Group AS has been gearing up for a potential IPO in Amsterdam as soon as the first quarter of next year at a valuation as high as €30 billion ($34.5 billion). Software company Visma AS, last valued at €19 billion in 2023, is considering going public in London in the first half of 2026, Bloomberg News reported. There are more multibillion-dollar IPOs in the works. Franco-German tankmaker KNDS NV and lift manufacturer TK Elevator GmbH have appointed financial advisers to help them prepare for a public offering sometime next year, Bloomberg News has reported. Some companies that put off going public in 2025, are now revisiting plans to go public, dealmakers say. “I would agree that Europe’s IPO market is the strongest it’s been in a few years, given the cadence of request for proposals and mandates that we see and the companies we know are likely to IPO in the next 12 to 24 months,” said Ed Sankey, who oversees Citigroup Inc.’s equity underwriting business across EMEA and Asia-Pacific. That’s not to say there aren’t risks ahead. “As always there is a chance that macro events, policy or geopolitical tensions or a correction can cause an increase in volatility and impact that ability to execute the pipeline,” he said. Equity markets have been jittery in the last few weeks on fears that valuations of stocks linked to artificial-intelligence spending are looking stretched. With that backdrop, some equity capital markets bankers are advising companies to tap markets while the iron is still hot. “The rational thing to do from an ECM perspective is to try to get business done as quickly as you can,” Andreas Bernstorff, global head of ECM at BNP Paribas SA, said. “If anything, people have been pulling their timelines forward to take advantage of what looks like a market that will be risk-on for the next six months or so.” Europe’s benchmark indexes, including the Stoxx 600, the UK’s FTSE 100, France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX have hit record highs this year. That helps encourage issuers to the market, although ironically it could also risk dashing sentiment if markets start drifting lower from the peaks. “The uncomfortable part of this IPO cycle is that it started with equity markets at or near all-time highs,” said Gareth McCartney, global head of capital markets origination at UBS Group AG. While this poses a risk, the breadth of sectors represented in Europe’s IPO pipeline should make it more sustainable, featuring key investment themes like defense, infrastructure and financials, he said. In fact, trading in Europe’s latest cohort of IPOs has even outshone firms that went public around the US government shutdown. “They’ve traded on par if not better than IPOs in the US,” Goldman Sachs’ Cormack said. “That’s a big tick in the box.” —With assistance from Swetha Gopinath.",

      "content": "Investor and author Ruchir Sharma believes the decade-long era of “American exceptionalism” is peaking, warning that the U.S. economy has become dangerously reliant on a single technological narrative. ‘America Is Now One Big Bet On AI’ Speaking on a recent episode of the Bankless podcast, the Breakout Capital CIO argued that the United States has effectively become “one big bet on AI,” a concentration of risk that masks deep structural vulnerabilities. Sharma offered a stark quantification of this dependency: approximately 40% of U.S. economic growth this year is derived directly from capital expenditure on building AI infrastructure. Furthermore, he noted that nearly 80% of the U.S. stock market's recent gains are driven by AI-related plays. Without this “maniacal focus” and the resulting wealth effect, Sharma suggests the underlying economy might be closer to stall speed. Tech Hype Is Masking US Debt And Deficits Sharma explained that America’s AI enthusiasm is papering over structural cracks, including a fiscal deficit breaching 6% of GDP and a national debt exceeding 100% of GDP. He argues that global investors are currently giving the U.S. a “free pass” on these deficits—and on potential headwinds from tariffs or immigration restrictions—because of an implicit bet that an AI-driven productivity boom will eventually neutralize the debt. When asked if markets are in a bubble, Sharma answered affirmatively, defining the current climate as “a good story that’s gone too far.” While noting that bubbles rarely burst on their own, he warned that a resurgence of inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy could serve as the catalyst to end the euphoria. See Also: Magnificent Seven Will Become Low-Profit Tech Utilities, Analyst Warns Concentration Creates Wealth, Diversification Preserves It “If the AI boom was not happening, the economy would be weaker,” Sharma noted. To hedge against this concentration risk, he advocates looking abroad. He pointed out that the “gap of outperformance” between the U.S. and international markets is finally closing, advising investors to diversify into undervalued assets in China, India, and recovering European markets like Greece.

      "content": "Representative image India’s economy is expected to remain firmly on a strong growth path over the next two years, with S&P Global Ratings projecting 6.5 per cent expansion in the current fiscal and 6.7 per cent in the next. The agency said a combination of tax cuts and monetary policy easing will bolster consumption-led growth despite the drag from higher US tariffs. As cited by news agency PTI, S&P noted that India’s real GDP grew 7.8 per cent in April–June, the fastest pace in five quarters. Official GDP numbers for July–September will be released on November 28. “We anticipate that India’s GDP will grow by 6.5 per cent in fiscal year 2026... and 6.7 per cent in fiscal 2027, with risks evenly balanced,” S&P said in its Economic Outlook Asia-Pacific report, adding that strong domestic consumption continues to support momentum. The RBI has forecast 6.8 per cent GDP growth for the current fiscal, compared to 6.5 per cent last year, PTI reported. According to S&P, securing a trade agreement with the US would help reduce uncertainty and lift confidence, particularly for labour-intensive sectors. It added that lowered GST rates , combined with income-tax cuts and interest rate reductions this year, will push consumption to play a larger role in growth than investment in FY26 and FY27. The government’s Budget for FY26 raised the income-tax rebate limit to Rs 12 lakh from Rs 7 lakh, providing Rs 1 lakh crore in relief to the middle class. In June, the RBI cut policy rates by 50 basis points to a three-year low of 5.5 per cent. Additionally, GST rates on about 375 items were slashed from September 22, making mass-consumption goods cheaper, PTI noted. S&P said elevated US tariffs continue to weigh on India’s export-oriented manufacturing, though there are early signs Washington may lower duties on some Indian products. The agency added that the US’s revised trade policy approach is forcing governments and firms to focus on securing exemptions, diverting resources from productivity-enhancing efforts.

Washington has not yet calculated the full benefits of imposing tariffs, US President Donald Trump said, noting that the opponents of tariffs \"serve hostile foreign interests.\" \"The full benefit of the tariffs has not yet been calculated in that many of the buyers of goods and products, in order to avoid paying the tariffs in the short term, 'stock up' by purchasing far more inventory than they can use in order to avoid tariff payments in the short term. That heavy inventory purchase is now, however, wearing thin, and soon tariffs will be paid on everything they apply to, without avoidance. Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success, safety and prosperity of the US,\" he wrote on his Truth Social page. The US leader added that he is looking forward to \"the US Supreme Court’s decision on this urgent and time-sensitive matter.\" Following the first hearing on the tariffs case in the US Supreme Court on November 5, The Washington Post reported that some judges had expressed doubts about the tariffs' legality. The case was brought to court after a group of business representatives filed a lawsuit against the US government, claiming that the tariffs were illegal and harmful to their companies. On August 29, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Trump lacked the authority to impose many of the announced tariffs. On September 4, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.",

      "content": "US officials and EU ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday for what is expected to be a \"frank\" discussion about the two sides' fraught trade deal. The United States' Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick are arriving in Brussels on Monday for what is expected to be a tense showdown with EU trade ministers. After months of recriminations on both sides of the Atlantic over the implementation of this summer’s trade deal, the EU and the US are now expected to confront their most contentious differences head-on. Washington will press to fast-track the deal’s rollout while pushing the bloc to scrap EU legislation it considers unfair to US companies, while Brussels will seek additional exemptions from the 15% US tariffs on its exportsand warn its counterparts about the potential fallout of US investigations into European products. Ahead of the meeting, EU diplomats said they expected the discussion to be “frank”. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and US president Donald Trump clinched a trade deal in July after weeks of negotiations in which the EU tried to minimise the impact of Washington’s newly aggressive trade agenda. In the end, von der Leyen was able to strike a deal that EU-produced goods arriving in the US would be taxed at a rate of 15% while Brussels lifted its duties on most US products. Presented by the Commission as the most advantageous deal it could get, the agreement has been widely criticised across the EU. The European Parliament, which has to vote on the Commission’s proposal to remove tariffs on US goods, is set to amend the deal and is discussing a 18-month suspension clause. The US is complaining that the EU’s legislative agenda is moving too slowly. EU lawmakers will vote on the text in January and they should agree on a common text with EU member states next March or April – a timescale radically longer than the Trump administration's preference. Greer raised the issue in a meeting with European Parliament president Roberta Metsola last Friday. EU faces criticism “with good confidence” The EU is ready to face US criticism “with good confidence” an EU diplomat said, noting that the legislative process in Brussels could have taken a lot longer. “To my knowledge, the US administration has not taken its decisions through Congress, so it doesn't take quite as long in the US,” another EU diplomat said, implyingthat the US trade agenda was mainly decided from the White House. The EU plans to show unity by handing over a list of proposed exemptions to the 15% tariffs they hope to obtain from the Americans. The list includes products such as wines, spirits and pasta. “American friends are very much aware of where the European Union would like to see tariff reductions,” the same EU diplomat said. For the Commission, which has competence to negotiate with Washington, the list of exemptions “remains a priority,” according to its deputy chief spokesperson, Arianna Podesta. The EU is also concerned about the future of its steel exports. The US already imposes 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium, and has extended them to some 407 derivatives. A consultation already underway may see further derivatives added to the list. As EU diplomats see it, adding tariffs on steel derivatives would go against the whole “spirit” of this summer's agreement. The same goes for investigations still open by Washington into products such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and medical devices. EU investments will also be on the agenda. Greer and Lutnick will meet in the afternoon, EU business representatives with EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič. The trade deal includes an EU pledge of €600 billion in investments in the US even though Brussels has no direct control over the private sector, which is the only force capable of actually delivering those investments. Monday’s meetings will not be an easy task for the Europeans, as US pressure has been unrelenting since Donald Trump returned to the White House, with the president repeatedly threatening new tariffs or targeting EU legislation he deems too restrictive for US companies. However, the EU has so far not looked intimidated, and is continuing to enforce the digital legislation that Trump and his administration have condemned. In the last few weeks, Brussels has launched antitrust investigations against Amazon and Microsoft and hit Google with a €2.95 billion for abusing its dominant position in the advertising technology industry – moves that have not gone unnoticed in Washington.

Websol Energy and Solar Industries India also posted multibagger gains.",
      "content": "For the past few years, solar energy has been one of the most powerful themes in India’s stock market. Names across the ecosystem, panel makers, developers, and EPC players, have delivered blockbuster returns as India rushed to add clean energy capacity and pushed companies to expand manufacturing aggressively. KPI Green Energy, for instance, has risen more than 600% in three years. Borosil Renewables has doubled in four years. Tata Power has delivered nearly 500% returns over five years. Adani Green, too, has doubled in two years.The standout star in this solar-led rally was Waaree Renewable Technologies, which delivered over 60,000% returns at one point before shifting to the mainboard. Websol Energy is another top performer, climbing tenfold in two years. Solar Industries India is no less impressive, rising nearly five times in three years.The rally was fuelled by national renewable energy targets, rising global appetite for solar components and a manufacturing boom triggered by government schemes. But now, for the first time in years, the narrative is beginning to turn.Talk of solar glutIndia's solar journey is at a crossroads, with manufacturing capacity growing far faster than demand. This has created what analysts describe as an emerging solar glut, as new factories are producing more modules than the market can absorb.In a recent report, ICRA said that while India's module production capacity is expected to rise to 165 GW, annual solar project installations are likely to be only around 45–50 GW — pointing to a significant potential overcapacity.The curtailment rate, the share of solar power that is generated but cannot be used or fed into the grid, rose to about 12% in October, the highest since May when the Grid Controller of India began publishing the data. On some days, nearly 40% of solar output was denied access to the national grid. Curtailments indicate how much electricity is generated but fails to reach consumers.Also Read: The forgotten Tata stock: Will investors ever recover Rs 25,000 crore loss that keeps getting bigger?An ET report earlier painted a grim picture: a drive through Gujarat’s industrial belt revealed sprawling warehouses packed with gleaming solar panels waiting for buyers who may never come.The great expansionIndia’s solar expansion over the past decade has been extraordinary. Ten years ago, the country had barely four gigawatts of installed solar capacity. Today, it stands at nearly 123 gigawatts, making India the world’s third-largest solar nation after China and the United States.But manufacturing has grown even more aggressively. India’s module manufacturing capacity has risen from 2.3 gigawatts in 2014 to 74 gigawatts by March 2025. Policymakers expect this to cross 110 gigawatts by March 2026 and approach 280 gigawatts by the end of the decade. Solar cell manufacturing, too, is projected to rise from about 25 gigawatts in 2025 to nearly 171 gigawatts by 2030.While installations are rising steadily, the pace is nowhere near fast enough to match the surge in factory output. India added around 26.6 gigawatts in the first nine months of 2025. For the full year, installations may touch 40–45 gigawatts — far below the manufacturing capacity being added. The result: oversupply, weaker pricing and reduced utilisation across many factories.A recent industry report by Rubix Industry Insights underscores how uneven the situation has become. Large players such as Adani Solar, Waaree Energies and Vikram Solar continue to run at about 80–85% capacity. But many smaller manufacturers are struggling to utilise even 20–25% of theirs.Also Read: Sensex target for 2026 at 107,000? Morgan Stanley makes big predictionThe manufacturing boom was partly built on expectations of strong exports, especially to the United States, historically India’s biggest overseas market. However, new US tariffs of up to 50% and anti-dumping investigations have sharply reduced demand for Indian modules abroad.Saatvik Green Energy recently said exporting to the US is no longer worth the risk. As exports shrink, more supply is being redirected into India, adding further pressure on domestic prices.Ashwin Patil, Head of Research at LKP Securities, points out that demand-side challenges are also weighing on the sector. Rooftop adoption still faces hurdles such as high upfront costs, lack of awareness and grid integration issues.Meanwhile, competition among manufacturers has intensified to the point where quality concerns sometimes arise as companies cut prices to stay afloat. Patil notes that the combination of rapid expansion, export barriers and cost disadvantages is hurting margins.However, he remains optimistic that government policies, subsidies and PLI schemes will help the sector navigate this phase. He believes solar remains central to India's energy transition and that the current overcapacity is likely to be a temporary phase rather than a structural setback.Abhishek Jain, Head of Research at Arihant Capital, said the sector is clearly entering a tougher phase. “Yes, the solar rally faces near-term pressure. A large amount of new capacity has come up, especially on the panel manufacturing side. With even more supply expected next year, pricing pressure is likely to intensify. Technology shifts and increasing backward integration by companies add further uncertainty.”He adds that the sector may remain range-bound until there is clarity on how demand and supply will balance out after FY26.Who are the most affectedCompanies that make only modules or cells are facing the hardest hit. Analysts say these smaller or single-product players, lacking integrated value chains or strong global footprints, feel the impact of falling prices more quickly.They face higher inventory losses, weaker margins and lower factory utilisation. Jain believes investors should moderate expectations from these stocks in the near term, as these companies may struggle to survive unless they consolidate, secure long-term contracts or move up the value chain.Meanwhile, integrated groups with strong balance sheets — Reliance, Adani, Waaree, Vikram Solar and Tata Power — are relatively better placed. These companies operate across multiple stages, from wafers and cells to modules and even utility-scale projects, allowing them to absorb volatility in any single segment.Pranay Aggarwal, CEO of Stoxkart, said near-term risks do not mean the long-term picture is damaged. According to him, high US tariffs, slower export demand, grid bottlenecks and upcoming ALMM-II rules will create short-term challenges.However, he says domestic demand, policy safeguards and the government's long-term renewable targets provide an important cushion. Aggarwal believes vertically integrated giants could emerge stronger as the industry consolidates around financially robust players.The glut spreads unevenlyThe impact of the glut is not uniform across the ecosystem. Manufacturers — especially smaller module makers — feel the most pressure as they are directly affected by falling module prices. Ancillary suppliers of EVA sheets, junction boxes, solar glass and aluminium frames may also see weaker realisations if module makers cut procurement budgets.Borosil Renewables, a key solar glass manufacturer, has already seen some pricing pressure, though long-term demand remains strong. On the other hand, solar EPC companies and rooftop installers benefit from falling equipment costs.Cheaper modules make solar projects more affordable and improve returns for developers. This also helps large renewable utilities such as Adani Green, Renew Power, SJVN Renewables and Tata Power, which can now build projects at lower cost, supporting their long-term earnings.The long-term story intactDespite current concerns, India’s long-term solar trajectory remains among the strongest globally. The country aims to reach about 280–300 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2030, up from 123 gigawatts today. New technologies like TOPCon and n-type cells are becoming mainstream.Storage-backed solar, hybrid projects and round-the-clock renewable tenders are gaining traction. Domestic manufacturing of wafers and cells is rising, which will eventually reduce import dependence. As these pieces fall into place, today’s excess capacity may gradually get absorbed.What should be an investor’s playbook for the solar theme?For investors, analysts broadly agree: the sector’s long-term prospects remain intact, but the easy multibagger phase is behind us.“Names like Vikram Solar and Waaree, which also have export opportunities (including in the US), could do relatively better. But overall, the sector may stay volatile, and investors should be selective and long-term focused,” said Jain.The next leg of returns will depend on selective investing rather than broad enthusiasm. Pure module makers may face prolonged pressure, while integrated giants and utility-scale developers are better positioned to weather the cycle.“Investors should moderate expectations from standalone module manufacturers and focus on financially strong, integrated players with full control across the value chain,” said Achin Bhardwaj, Founder at Daksham Capital.The solar sector is undergoing a shift from scarcity to oversupply. For years, companies enjoyed strong pricing power because capacity was limited and demand was booming. Today, capacity has raced ahead of installations, exports have slowed and prices are falling. But this reset could reshape investor expectations.“The next stretch may not offer the kind of windfall gains we saw earlier. It’s still a promising space over the long run, but the easy money has already been made. Going forward, selectivity and balance-sheet strength will matter far more than momentum,” said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

      "content": "File photo: US treasury secretary Scott Bessent (Picture credit: AP) US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has insisted the United States is not heading for a recession in 2026, expressing strong confidence that President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy and new trade agreements will bring economic relief over the next year. Speaking to NBC News’ Meet the Press, Bessent said he was “very, very optimistic on 2026” and argued that the administration had “set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy”. Bessent said the White House expects healthcare costs to fall and promised fresh announcements on that front this week. At the same time, he acknowledged that some parts of the economy are struggling, echoing earlier comments from National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett that interest-rate-sensitive sectors, especially housing, have been in recession. Bessent says inflation ‘has nothing to do with tariffs’ as U.S. rolls them back: Full interview Bessent also pointed out that the 43-day government shutdown — the longest on record — had squeezed economic activity. A recent NBC News poll showed that nearly two-thirds of registered voters believe the administration has not delivered on the economy or cost of living. Despite this, Bessent highlighted Trump’s sweeping domestic policy package — the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” — saying its various tax breaks and income-boosting measures are still kicking in and will support households next year. As per CNBC, the law introduces benefits including a larger state-and-local tax deduction, tax relief on overtime and tip income, and a senior “bonus” to offset Social Security taxes. Bessent blamed the services sector, rather than Trump’s tariffs, for ongoing inflation. He said lower energy prices should help cool inflation further, which currently sits around 3% annually. Inflation is running 0.5% higher in Democratic-led states, a gap Bessent attributed to “increased regulation”, reported Reuters. Hassett, speaking separately to Fox News, predicted that 2026 would be “an absolute blockbuster year,” although he warned of a “hiccup” in fourth-quarter data because of the shutdown. He said growth could slow to between 1.5% and 2% before picking up strongly next year. Bessent also defended the administration’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine peace push, telling NBC News that Trump is “a president of peace” and arguing that Europe's repeated sanctions packages had failed. He supported the 28-point peace proposal backed by the US, despite concerns raised by Ukraine, European governments and American lawmakers. Bessent further used the interview to urge Senate Republicans to end the filibuster if Democrats trigger another government shutdown, calling the recent closure a “1.5% hit to GDP”.

      "description": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will unveil her Autumn Budget on November 26. It’s a high-stakes moment for the UK fashion industry.",
      "content": "Tensions have been rising in the UK these past few weeks as speculation has ramped up about what will be unveiled in the Autumn Budget. Reports that Chancellor Rachel Reeves planned to break the Labour Party’s election promise not to raise income taxes caused consternation. Then, last week, government sources told the Financial Times that Reeves had decided against the move after receiving better-than-expected economic forecasts. Still, other tax changes — higher rates, reduced reliefs — are likely when Reeves unveils her budget on November 26, as Labour tries to plug the estimated £20 billion hole in the UK’s public finances. For the British fashion industry, the budget comes at a high-stakes moment of acute cost pressure, low business confidence and mounting global competition. Brands are already struggling with rising taxes — including higher employer National Insurance — and fear further increases that could force price rises, squeeze already-thin margins, or stall hiring and investment. Meanwhile, uncertainty over business rates reform threatens both independent retailers and large flagship stores. The industry is also concerned that investment in critical areas — from manufacturing and ‘Made in the UK’ infrastructure to circularity and sustainability innovation — may be deprioritized if the budget focuses on fiscal tightening over industrial strategy. Perhaps the most pressing concern is that the UK has become less competitive internationally, particularly post-Brexit. Export-driven fashion businesses face ongoing trade friction, tariffs and weak government support for international growth. Removing VAT-free shopping is repeatedly cited as a major drag on tourism, luxury spending and overall UK attractiveness. With business confidence down and companies operating in a volatile global market, decisions on tax, trade and industrial support will significantly shape whether British fashion can remain competitive at home and abroad. Here’s what British fashion and luxury trade bodies, lobbyists, brands and manufacturers want to see from the 2025 Autumn Budget. Laura Weir, CEO of the British Fashion Council (BFC) British fashion is a cultural powerhouse and a significant economic driver for the UK, but it continues to face significant challenges post-Brexit and Covid. The BFC values the UK government’s funding commitments for the fashion sector outlined earlier this year in the Creative Industries Sector Plan; however, businesses still encounter difficulties in these tough times, and the budget offers an opportunity for the government to further support growth, opportunities and employment in this vital £67.5 billion sector. The BFC has urged the chancellor to announce measures that would reduce costs and open up opportunities for British businesses. These include introducing a VAT Retail Export Scheme to incentivize international spending in the UK market, reducing business rates for retail and creative businesses, increasing export promotion funding for the fashion sector, and investing in creative skills and education. Joshua Schulman, CEO of Burberry (from Burberry’s Q2 earnings call ) We are very proud of our British heritage, and we are proud to be a significant employer in Britain with our facilities here in London, with our stores, with our store network, and of course, with our manufacturing facility in Yorkshire. From our perspective, what we would like the government to focus on is strengthening international competitiveness and attracting customers from around the world right here in the UK. We believe that one of the things that the government could proactively unlock would be to make London, again, the number one shopping destination in Europe. We would like to see progressive policies that reinvigorate international visitor spending, which support jobs and stimulate growth across the whole visitor economy. And, perhaps, the most important of those in our world would be around changing the VAT refund scheme and putting us on par with European countries. We know that our tourist business here in London has gone down ever since the VAT refund was taken away. There is a significant opportunity here in a proactive way for all of us to come together between government and business to unlock further growth in the UK. Adam Mansell, CEO of the UK Fashion and Textiles Association (UKFT) Our top priority is the introduction of a textile-specific extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme. Our pilot work shows that an intelligent, data-driven EPR system is entirely deliverable and could raise up to £1 billion a year to drive genuine circularity — particularly closed-loop recycling, which is the sector’s holy grail. UK businesses across the supply chain are united behind this, and with the EU moving ahead with mandatory textile EPR, the UK cannot afford to be left behind. We’re also calling for the reinstatement of VAT-free shopping, which would boost tourist spending and directly support the UK manufacturers supplying luxury brands. On exports, we need the Tradeshow Access Program back, alongside stronger embassy support. It was a simple, low-cost intervention that delivered a £1:£40 return and helped companies of all sizes enter new markets. To protect sovereign capability, we are also urging the government to adopt UK-centric public procurement rules, particularly for technical textiles. This would provide far greater security of supply for critical products across defence, aerospace and health, while safeguarding and creating thousands of jobs and stimulating long-term investment. Beyond that, we need the government to close the de minimis loophole on low-value direct-to-consumer (DTC) imports that don’t meet UK standards; expand innovation funding with clearer research and development (R&D) tax credit rules and full support for SMEs; address rising employment costs; keep childrenswear VAT-free; and crucially, make the Apprenticeship Levy more flexible so businesses can actually invest in the skills and creativity this industry needs. Helen Brocklebank, CEO of Walpole Walpole has laid out five priorities ahead of the Autumn Budget. First, we urge the government to take a measured approach to business rates reform. Large premises such as hotels, department stores and flagship retailers act as ‘anchor’ assets on the high streets, which draw in high-spending visitors who then also spend in smaller cafés, restaurants and boutiques. As such, the government’s plan to introduce extra business rates on premises over £500,000 is a concern. This will be a direct hit to flagship boutiques and high-end hotels, but the impact will be felt more widely across business. We have called on the chancellor to exclude retail, hospitality and leisure businesses of all sizes from this additional business rates burden. Walpole is also calling for full expensing to be extended to secondhand plant and machinery. Many British luxury manufacturers rely on heritage equipment, often purchased refurbished. This investment is currently excluded from capital allowances and creates an unintended penalty for smaller and sustainability-focused makers. Third, we want to see a competitive tax landscape, including the introduction of a modern visitor incentive scheme for international visitors. The absence of this policy continues to place the UK at a disadvantage to France, Italy and Spain, where high-spending tourists can reclaim VAT. Likewise, if the chancellor delivered a freeze on alcohol duty and introduced cellar door relief, she could help the luxury wines and spirits industry thrive. Fourth, the Growth and Skills Levy needs to work more effectively for creative and craft skills. Luxury businesses train specialist makers, designers and hospitality professionals, but the current system lacks the flexibility required for businesses. Greater freedom in how levy funds can be used would allow the sector to expand high-quality skills and create new career pathways. Finally, small businesses exporting urgently need support to navigate complex sustainability regulations in the EU and other global markets. For a sector that sells roughly 70% of its products overseas, clarity and help with compliance is essential to growth. Tamara Cincik, founder of Fashion Roundtable The key issue is we have a government who wants to plug what they see as a financial black hole, without talking about the impacts of Brexit and Covid. The impact of tariffs on business with our closest and largest trading partner [the EU] cannot be underestimated. This relationship needs to be reinvigorated, starting with a Youth Mobility Scheme to support young people from the UK and the EU to learn, work and travel more fluidly again between the two regions. Meanwhile, the luxury and high-end level of the sector is losing out due to the UK’s decision to not have tax-free shopping. This is impacting travel and hospitality, too, and has gifted sales to Paris and Milan. An increase in National Insurance contributions, business rates and tax would impede growth rather than encourage investment. Many in business are dealing with the results of a sluggish economy, caught in the debt cycle of repaying [Covid-era] fiscal borrowing in a higher inflationary cycle than previous decade. The UK has a burgeoning sustainability-driven fashion sector and this really needs incentivizing. I feel we need the same kind of tax incentives to manufacture here as the UK film and theatre industry has for productions made here. That would keep costs down for manufacturers and retailers, and they can then promote their provenance story while nurturing brand loyalty with domicile consumers. We cannot win a price war, but we can win a provenance debate. I would like to see the UK’s heritage brands incentivized to bring their manufacturing back to the UK, tax incentives for British-made brands, or local government intervention to open up empty retail units for local smaller brands to deliver pop-ups — imagine what that would do for local regeneration. UK-made public procurement would transform UK manufacturing, which, in turn, would stabilize orders, boost investment and therefore enable manufacturers to level their cash flow and happily work with small brands for London Fashion Week . Stable order books nurture investment and growth, and this is what the sector is calling for. Jess McGuire Dudley, managing director of John Smedley Of course, everyone supports the principle of paying fair wages and the uplift in the national living wage to do so. But it feels short-sighted for the current government to focus purely on adding more costs to UK businesses, without also looking to bring procurement contracts or other forms of manufacturing support back to the UK. It’s created a cycle of costs going up and volumes coming down, which puts jobs at risk. Instead, the government could connect both aspects and focus on supporting both the employees and the industry they work within. A good start would be looking at a percentage of school or military uniforms, which could be brought back to the UK textiles industry. This is where some government support, or, preferably, some legislation, would level the playing field. Ruth Rands, founder of Herd All Herd wool pieces, including yarn, knitwear and tweed, are made in Britain — from farms in the North of England, through the few remaining historical factories, mills and knitting studios, to hand-finished garment. The depth of intergenerational expertise from hundreds of years of wool making, proximity, flexibility and smallish scale, make working locally a natural choice for us. Alongside quality, it also assures us of ethical practices in farming and working standards, supports innovation via R&D tax relief and reduces unnecessary transportation miles around the globe. It is without a doubt a more expensive option than overseas economies, but justifies the price as the quality of finish is unparalleled. We know, however, that there are many lower cost and quality options overseas, and that our suppliers are constantly struggling to compete. We have seen two of our suppliers close their doors this year, with their valuable skills, world-class equipment and know-how dispersed around the world, often to Asia. The concept of British heritage is going nowhere, but how much is actually made here? Our globally recognized style heritage is such an important cultural and commercial export, and for it to fail would be a lose-lose outcome for everyone involved. Only by championing the British manufacturing industry — and using it — will there be a future as illustrious as its past.",

      "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Delhi on Monday after concluding his three day visit to Johannesburg, South Africa where he took part in the G20 Summit hosted for the first time under South African presidency. He engaged with several world leaders and attended multiple summit sessions with the focus on global growth, climate action, and development priorities of the Global South. Despite the boycott from the US, leaders actively participated and approved the G20 declaration. Trump remarked that South Africa’s presidency is a “total disgrace.” Trump also imposed 30 per cent tariffs, which is recorded as the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. The attending nations endorsed a 122-point document centred on global cooperation, multilateral restructuring, health, security, technology, and sustainable development. PM Modi presented a six-point agenda aimed at strengthening global restructuring with focus on countering drug-terror chains, rapid response teams, active healthcare, and crisis management. Among his key bilateral meetings was one with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, where both sides agreed on countering terrorism together. PM Modi actively engaged with several other leaders, including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Taking to his X handle, PM Modi wrote, “The successful Johannesburg G20 will contribute to a prosperous and sustainable planet. My meetings and interactions with world leaders were very fruitful and will deepen India’s bilateral linkages with various nations. \" The successful Johannesburg G20 will contribute to a prosperous and sustainable planet.

      "title": "A decade after Paris, climate diplomacy is about saving itself",
      "description": "The conclusion of COP30 in Brazil was marked by a historic agreement aimed at furthering the shift away from fossil fuels. Despite heated debates and nations standing firm against the use of oil, gas, and coal, a sudden fire at the conference venue led to an unexpected evacuation.",
      "content": "Two weeks of frenzied negotiations over the planet’s faltering fight against climate change had come down to this: a pre-dawn battle over shifting away from fossil fuels. The European Union, the UK and other nations had drawn a red line on the second-to-last day of COP30 in Brazil, insisting they would walk away rather than accept a deal that failed to advance a prior commitment to transition away from oil, gas and coal. That agreement had been won at COP28 in Dubai, marking the first time the term “fossil fuels” — responsible for the vast bulk of global warming — had ever appeared in a final text over three decades of United Nations climate summits.Now a large faction of countries, egged on by Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in his role as host, had made a renewed push against fossil fuels, turning it into the proving ground for both climate cooperation and the very idea of multilateralism in a rapidly fracturing world. But Brazilian diplomats leading the summit, under pressure from Arab states and Russia, didn’t embrace the proposal. Just as the threat to scupper a final marquee agreement arose, a fire tore through the venue in the rainforest city of Belém, forcing an hourslong evacuation.In the end, the holdouts found enough reason to back a deal — if largely to send a signal that countries can still unite behind the climate cause. “There was a will to make sure this agreement didn’t fall,” said Ed Miliband, the UK’s energy secretary. “Nobody in that room really wanted to be the people who brought the thing down.” Instead, he added, “there was actually a will to keep the show on the road.”The EU, UK and their allies won a small victory coded in the minutiae of diplomatic language: a concession that nations should implement carbon-cutting plans “taking into account the decisions” made over years of climate talks, including the fossil fuel transition commitment made in Dubai. And so it continues. The sluggish business of climate diplomacy that is the annual UN Conference of Parties avoided collapse into a no-deal outcome. After a two-week summit near the mouth of the Amazon marked by sweltering heat and daily rainstorms, gone is the grand ambition of the decade after 2015 Paris Agreement when nearly 200 countries joined in a pledge to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. Left in its place is a push to actually implement the world’s climate commitments as the 1.5C target slips out of reach. And that well-meaning effort can easily morph into a mandate to reinforce multilateralism — even at the expense of ambition.“We knew this COP would take place in stormy political waters,” Simon Stiell, the UN climate change executive secretary, said at the summit’s close. “COP30 showed that climate cooperation is alive and kicking.”From the outset, this year’s talks were expected to be more routine, following a series of milestone summit agreements: a decision to create a fund addressing losses and damages from global warming in 2022, the commitment on fossil fuels in 2023, and a deal last year to triple the amount of money available to help developing countries. The rigid cycles of work prescribed by the Paris Agreement hadn’t set up any blockbusters on the summit agenda. Perhaps that’s why the chief imperative appeared at times to be simply affirming multilateralism. The final agreement of COP30 was even dubbed the “Global Mutirão,” after a Brazilian term for collective action. COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago laid out the stakes before delegates traveled to Belém, telling a Bloomberg Green event: “We have to convince people it's worthwhile to continue to negotiate.”But then came Lula’s bold declaration that countries should prepare to map their paths away from oil, gas and coal. Speaking to world leaders just before COP30 talks got underway, the Brazilian president delivered a warning that “the climate regime is not immune to the rationale of the zero-sum game that has prevailed in the international order.” He called for “road maps to justly and strategically reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilize the necessary resources to achieve these goals.”Lula’s road maps became a rallying cry — and a defining fight — over the next two weeks. “Maybe now we’ll actually have something to negotiate about,” quipped one delegate. Another veteran negotiator said he’d never given such “bad advice” as telling his boss there wouldn’t be any drama in Belém.Some delegates took up the concept as an imperative to give countries guidance on what ditching fossil fuels meant in practice. The climate summit could help answer difficult questions about how to proceed: Should edging coal out of the energy mix be the priority? Where does natural gas fit in? And how long should the transition take? The idea gained momentum, especially among ambitious countries frustrated with the pace of action to mitigate climate change as well as those wanting more financial support to deal with its consequences. It also became a call to arms for the tens of thousands of Indigenous peoples, clergy and activists who flooded the streets of Belém on Nov. 15, the first time in three years in which a host country had allowed protests alongside the talks.As diplomats inside the COP30 venue deliberated the wording of detailed proposals for measuring the world’s progress, activists outside insisted on “more solutions” and “less diplomacy” — the very message proclaimed on a banner hoisted at the march by Franciscan friar Vicente Imhof. “We keep hearing proposals, but what matters are concrete actions,” he said. “Being overly diplomatic just to avoid confronting those in power hasn’t worked since the time of Jesus Christ.”Marina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister, amplified Lula’s call with an impassioned plea of her own. Yet she seemed at times like the only other voice in the Brazilian government arguing for the plan.“We must chart pathways and secure the financial resources and technical support needed to reduce the high dependence on these fuels,” she told delegates, emphasizing the particular reliance of developing countries. Lula’s call had “caught people’s imagination,” and Silva’s entreaty “inspired even more,” said Rachel Kyte, the UK’s special representative for climate. “This is one of those things that gathers energy.”The clamor for a concrete path to exit fossil fuels reached its pinnacle at a packed news conference Nov. 18. With security officials holding back hordes of attendees and senior officials from almost 20 nations in attendance, an envoy from the extremely vulnerable Marshall Islands laid out the stakes.“The transition away from fossil fuels is key to keeping the door open to 1.5C,” Tina Stege said. “So let’s get behind the idea of a fossil fuels road map, work together and make a plan.”Roughly 80 nations had united behind the push — a significant number, but short of the supermajority that forced the landmark pledge to transition away from fossil fuels in Dubai two years ago. They met determined opposition from the likes of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Corrêa do Lago, the COP30 president who’d laid out four different areas for high-level consultations, described significant resistance to the plan and then left it out of draft texts circulated in the final days of the summit. The fire that engulfed the tented ceiling above country pavilions forced negotiations into hotels dotted around the city, evoking destructive wildfires fueled by rising temperatures.In past climate summits, the US might have stepped in to broker a compromise. American diplomats teaming up with Chinese and European counterparts had shaped final deals before, including the breakthrough in Paris. But US President Donald Trump’s decision to snub the conference after declaring climate change a “scam” had left a power vacuum in Belém. Officials from China didn’t take a prominent role in the negotiations. Attendees flocked to the country’s splashy pavilion to collect cuddly panda souvenirs. But Chinese officials emphasized their opposition to tariffs and trade policy as a threat to exports of green technologies — and steered clear of thorny debates about fossil fuels.Talks spilled into Saturday’s early hours after the EU, UK and others put forward their make-or-break demand. The compromise that emerged around dawn included a written acknowledgment of the Dubai fossil fuels commitment. Corrêa do Lago also shaped a separate initiative to focus on the issue. The side deal means the COP30 presidency will spend the next year considering road maps for shifting away from fossil fuels and combatting deforestation. But the initiative isn’t tucked into formal workflows under the Paris Agreement, meaning it lacks the backing of international law. “I know some of you had higher ambitions,” Corrêa do Lago told delegates. “I will try not to disappoint you.”The lackluster final deal — which also included a new call for countries to triple finance for climate adaptation by 2035 — reflects a process that keeps countries locked into decades-old demarcations of who’s rich and who’s poor while requiring consensus to seal any deal. The weighty mandate to defend multilateralism added even more pressure to water down language to secure approval.Supporters insist that for all its flaws, the annual UN climate summit remains an essential venue for poor and vulnerable nations to hold their richer counterparts to account. And, they say, some countries’ demand for stronger language on cutting planet-warming emissions shows those less-powerful nations can still hold the line. A key test will come next year when two countries with little in common — Turkey and Australia — share responsibility for COP31.“There is no way to achieve global climate goals without collective action,” said Rachel Cleetus, a senior policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “How can a small island state force the EU to do anything? Multilateralism is the only way to give voice to those with less geopolitical power.”",

Obviously, what is happening with AI and risk appetite, but the shorter-term theme and the theme that the market can get it, wrap its hands around is the question of whether the Fed is going to be hawkish or dovish,” he said in an interview to ET Now, noting how central bank uncertainty has taken centre stage.Markets took comfort late last week when a dovish comment from the New York Fed President lifted equities. Englander pointed out the dynamic behind that move. “And they have sent out very mixed signals and the rally at the end of the week that we saw in equities was pretty closely tied with the Williams indication, the New York Fed Chief indication that he is leaning towards a cut. It is not guaranteed, but it sort of gave the market some hope that cuts were coming.”Still, he warned that expectations might be running ahead of the data. “Just to be clear, we do not expect the Fed to deliver all the cuts that are priced in. So, there could still be some angst to come, but that for now the market is taking comfort from those comments.”A Rate Decision Without Labour DataThe upcoming meeting is unusual: the Fed will not have October’s household labour survey, and November’s official jobs data will only be released after policymakers gather in December. Englander explained the implications of the gap.“Yes, that is right that they are actually skipping the October labour data, they just were not able to do the household survey and so they are going to put out the November data after the FOMC meeting in December. So, they would not have that when they meet.”He highlighted that the absence of fresh data creates room for disagreement inside the Fed.“Now, there are different views on the FOMC about what you do in that case. Like some of them say well you make your best guess and you act on it. Others say, you go more slowly. We will have to see how this plays out.”Given the information void, private-sector indicators may take on more weight than usual.“We will be getting other data and, for example, the ADP data gets more attention these days than it ever did before and some of the other private sector. So, the market is pricing about a 60% chance of a cut, a 25 basis point cut in December. We do not think that it is a done deal. We do think that it is going to be very close, but there is still a lot of data to be received even if it is unofficial or non-governmental data before that FOMC.”Tech Volatility Still in FocusRecent volatility in tech-heavy names has raised questions about whether the sector could see another round of profit-taking. Englander pointed out that while there are tech-specific concerns, the broader macro backdrop remains important.“Well, there is an element that is like tech specific, which I am not an expert on. It is hard enough to follow FX and fixed income markets. But there is an element that kind of tracks risk appetite, whether the macro environment is friendly and we think that should be friendly notwithstanding that the Fed would not deliver the cuts because we think that there is some productivity gains and profit gains that will continue in 2026.”He stressed that potential lack of rate cuts would not imply economic stress.“It is not that the Fed would not cut because they are mean. They would not cut because they do not have to, because the economy can deal with the higher rate. So, we think that there could be some good news there sort of broadly speaking.”Dollar Strength Seen ContinuingDespite soft labour numbers and an improving inflation backdrop, Englander remains constructive on the US dollar.“Yes, we are dollar bulls and the market is going our way. Our year-end forecast is 115. So, we are not that far off it and we expect that for the euro only, we expect the euro to go down to 112 by the middle of next year.”He said the macro story may be better than it appears, with both strong growth and weak employment numbers possibly pointing to a productivity boost.“We think that to us the biggest story out there is the possibility that both sides of the macro balance sheet are correct, that the growth numbers, GDP now is running at (4:50) for Q3 that is correct, the soft employment numbers are correct and what we are getting is a boost to productivity growth. Historically that is dollar positive.”This backdrop tends to support equities as well.“It is also very friendly to equities and ultimately jobs recover, it just does not happen immediately.”Overall, Englander remains comfortable with his constructive dollar outlook.“So, for the dollar we are actually pretty positive on it as in the course of the year and what is happening now is that some of the comments are sort of supporting the dollar against the euro. The US, I mean there are some risks there, I mean the Supreme Court on tariffs and so on, but I think that by and large we are comfortable with our long dollar view right now.”",

      "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: S&P Global Ratings has lifted its 2026 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for Asia-Pacific to 4.2 per cent from 4.0 per cent, with the Malaysian economy now projected to grow at a faster pace of 4.5 per cent. In its Economic Outlook Asia-Pacific First Quarter (1Q) 2026: Signs of Relief report, S&P cited resilient demand, stronger technology exports and reduced tariff uncertainty for the improved regional outlook. \"We think a tentative thaw in United States (US)-China ties and, in many economies, resilient domestic demand should help Asia-Pacific growth hold up in 2026,” the credit rating agency said. According to the report’s tables, Malaysia’s GDP growth has been revised upwards by 0.2 percentage points (ppts) to 4.5 per cent in 2026, with consumer inflation at 1.9 per cent and policy rate steady at 2.75 per cent. For China, S&P raised its 2026 GDP forecast to 4.4 per cent from 4.0 per cent previously due to a reduction in US tariffs on the country and the economic resilience shown in the third quarter (3Q) of 2025. For Asia, excluding China, the rating agency said both exports and domestic demand generally held up well through 3Q 2025, supported by strong shipments of technology products such as semiconductors. \"We still expect a slowdown in much of the region in 2026, stemming from the US tariffs. But we have revised up our export forecasts on an improved outlook for tech exports and the relatively favourable outcome of the US-China negotiations. \"In all, we have raised our 2025 GDP growth forecasts for Asia-Pacific, excluding China, by 0.2 ppts to 4.4 per cent and the 2026 one by 0.2 ppts to 4.2 per cent,” it added. However, S&P said that it expects uncertainty around US tariffs to remain in 2026, in part because of indications that the US administration may use tariffs for political purposes although visibility has improved. Meanwhile, the rating agency said Asia-Pacific central banks have lowered their policy rates by an average 65 basis points (bps) so far in 2025, following an average cut of 40 bps in 2024. \"We see little scope for further cuts, chiefly because policy rates have for the most part already descended close to our estimates of neutral policy interest rates. \"Among key factors influencing monetary policy, inflation is not currently a problem in Asia-Pacific. We expect consumer inflation to mostly remain low amid moderate energy prices and redirection of exports away from the US,” it added. In general, S&P said, Asia-Pacific currencies are expected to strengthen slightly against the US dollar through to the end of 2026. - Bernama",

      "content": "Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], November 24 (ANI): Domestic markets opened flat on Monday as the tug of war between bulls and bears continued, starting another week of cautious optimism amid expectations that indices may soon touch fresh record highs. The Nifty 50 index opened at 26,122.80, gaining 54.65 points or 0.21 per cent, while the BSE Sensex began the day at 85,320.04, up 88.12 points or 0.10 per cent. With the steady opening momentum, both indices moved closer to their all-time highs, Nifty's record peak of 26,277.37 and Sensex's high of 85,978.25, both achieved in September 2024. Market experts noted that Indian equities are holding firm despite global pressure, with investors closely tracking upcoming U.S. economic data to gauge how tariffs might impact the American economy and influence future policy decisions. Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, told ANI, \"Indian markets will watch the Rupee closely. Friday's market fall coincided with the Indian Rupee breaking through stops at ₹ 88.8 per US dollar and then breaking the sentimental level of ₹ 89 per US dollar. Trade and portfolio flows weakness and the lack of apparent/visible RBI intervention impacted Rupee sentiment.\" In the broader market on the NSE, volatility eased, and most indices opened in the green. Nifty 100 was up by 0.10 per cent, while Nifty Smallcap and Midcap shares opened flat but remained under pressure. Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said, \"India stands out, with domestic resilience once again cushioning the impact of external volatility and keeping investor sentiment relatively stable. Market participants will be watching closely for any signs of moderation in the labour market or broader economic activity, as softer readings could strengthen expectations of further policy easing by the Federal Reserve. Global sentiment remains mixed, while there are no fresh negative triggers, risk-on appetite continues to be measured.\" Among sectoral indices, except Nifty Auto, Nifty FMCG, Nifty Pharma and Nifty Realty, all other sectors opened with gains. Nifty IT surged 1.34 per cent in early trade, leading the rally. Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered analyst and Founder of Alphamojo Financial Services, added, \"Nifty is currently hovering near its All-Time High (ATH) of 26,250 a breakout above this resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The week might be tough for the index, as FIIs have shown heavy selling for the last four months, coupled with the Rupee hitting an all-time low of around ₹ 90, which might weaken market strength.\" Across Asia, major markets traded in the green at the time of reporting. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index surged 1.4 per cent, South Korea's KOSPI was up more than 1 per cent, and Taiwan's weighted index gained 0.9 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei 225 remained shut for a holiday. Meanwhile, U.S. futures were trading higher as investors awaited key economic data releases. Producer inflation, retail sales and industrial production numbers for September will be released on Tuesday, followed by the third-quarter GDP data on Wednesday. (ANI)",

A firmer dollar typically weighs on gold by making the metal more expensive for holders of other currencies.Today, the US Dollar Index, DXY, was hovering near the 100.20 mark, gaining 0.03 or 0.03%.Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting, released Wednesday, showed policymakers opted to cut interest rates, but also cautioned that the decision carried risks of persistent inflation and could undermine public trust in the central bank.Separately, delayed data from the U.S. Labour Department revealed that September non-farm payrolls rose by 119,000 — more than twice the projected increase of 50,000.Adding to concerns, U.S. factory activity fell to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up import costs, dampening demand.According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the likelihood of a December rate cut eased to 69% on Monday, down from 74% in the previous session. Expectations had jumped sharply from 40% on Friday after dovish remarks from New York Fed President John Williams.Gold rates in physical marketsGold price today in DelhiStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Delhi stand at Rs 93,064/8 grams, while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 1,00,136/8 grams.Gold price today in MumbaiStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Mumbai stand at Rs 93,104/8 grams, while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 1,00,136/8 grams.Gold price today in ChennaiStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Chennai stand at Rs 92,640/8 grams, while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 99,600/8 grams.Gold price today in HyderabadStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Hyderabad stand at Rs 92,792/8 grams, while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 99,752/8 grams.

      "description": "Reliance Industries is staging its strongest rally since 2020, with the stock up over 26% in 2025 and adding Rs 4.4 lakh crore in market value. Now near the Rs 21-lakh crore mark and at a fresh 52-week high, the surge is driven by rising refining margins, telecom tariff hikes, strong retail momentum and multiple value-unlocking triggers across its businesses.",
      "content": "After a forgettable 2024, Reliance Industries, India’s largest company by market capitalisation, is now delivering its strongest bull run since the Covid year of 2020. The blue-chip Nifty stock has already surged over 26% in 2025, adding a staggering Rs 4.4 lakh crore to its market value, which now hovers near the Rs 21-lakh crore mark. The stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,557.95 on the BSE on Friday, signalling that the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate is back with force.What’s driving this sharp rally? A perfect storm of catalysts across Reliance’s sprawling businesses — from surging refining margins and telecom tariff hikes to strong retail momentum and upcoming value-unlocking triggers.Jio IPOJefferies has raised its target enterprise value for Reliance Jio to a whopping $180 billion, projecting that the company is well-placed to deliver 18%/21% CAGR in revenues/EBITDA over FY26–28. The key drivers include rising mobile tariffs, strong growth in the home broadband business led by fixed wireless access (FWA), the scale-up of the enterprise business, and monetisation of its tech stack. The brokerage has also raised its target EV/EBITDA multiple to 15x — a 10% premium to Bharti Airtel — citing Jio’s superior growth outlook.The telecom business is set to become an even bigger catalyst. Market expert Sudip Bandyopadhyay expects the next quarter’s results to be “very positive” as the benefits of ARPU increases flow through fully. He also anticipates another ARPU hike before the end of the fiscal, which could trigger fresh momentum.“Apart from that, of course, as we know, at the AGM there was an announcement that value unlocking through the listing of the telecom business will be done in the first half of the next calendar year. So that is expected to happen, and this value-unlocking event and its announcement will also trigger a lot of excitement in the counter,” Bandyopadhyay said.But the telecom story is just one piece of the puzzle. ICICI Securities has upgraded Reliance to BUY with a target price of Rs 1,735, driven by strong retail momentum, visible progress in new energy initiatives, and the rising importance of its media segment. The brokerage projects a consolidated EPS CAGR of 15% over FY26–28, supported by Reliance’s diversified growth engines and improved visibility on returns. Free cash flow yields and return ratios are also expected to improve ahead of earlier estimates.Also Read | Chris Wood of Jefferies sells Reliance Industries shares to buy Adani stockO2C comebackThe oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business, long seen as under pressure, is staging a strong comeback. Asia refining margins have improved amid healthy fundamentals, refinery maintenance, seasonal swings, and geopolitical developments. Spreads of middle distillates (diesel and jet fuel) and gasoline have strengthened on resilient demand, with the outlook for jet fuel particularly positive ahead of winter heating needs, UBS said.“Though we expect some moderation in spreads in December (as refineries come back from maintenance), we foresee above mid-cycle spreads sustaining amid project delays. Transportation fuels account for 66% of Reliance O2C’s products meant for sale. We build in O2C EBITDA rising from Rs 295 bn in H1 to Rs 340 bn in H2 FY26, and further to Rs 648 bn in FY27,” UBS said, while maintaining a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,820.Last week, RIL said it has halted the import of Russian oil for processing at its export-only refinery in Jamnagar as it works to comply with European Union sanctions.Bandyopadhyay dismissed concerns that reduced Russian crude purchases could hurt margins. “The way GRMs are shaping up, the way things are moving, Reliance is very well positioned to maintain its profitability and revenue from this segment as well,” he said, adding that “the O2C business has been performing well overall.”Also Read | Reliance halts Russian oil imports for its only-for-export refinery amid US pressureThe retail business presents another potential value-unlocking opportunity. “Something can be done as far as value unlocking is concerned in the retail business — that has also become pretty big and some value-unlocking measures can be taken there,” Bandyopadhyay noted. “If and when that does get done, there will be excitement in the counter.”With multiple growth engines firing simultaneously — telecom tariff hikes and a potential listing, refining margin expansion, retail strength, and progress in new energy — Reliance is positioned for sustained momentum. “We have been positive on Reliance for quite some time and we maintain our positive view,” Bandyopadhyay said. “With a slightly long-term view, Reliance can be bought even now.”For the 44 lakh shareholders who weathered the turbulence of 2024, 2025 is shaping up to be a redemption story, and if these catalysts unfold as expected, this bull run may just be getting started.",

      "content": "RBI’s forex reserves have dropped around $10 billion since mid-September, indicating that it may have stepped in to defend the rupee against the dollar. The Indian Rupee strengthened 0.4% against the US Dollar on Monday as the Reserve Bank of India intervened to prop up the local currency. The INR-USD exchange rate stood at 89.15 as against 89.48 in the previous close. The Reserve Bank of Indian likely intervened to support the rupee before the local spot market opened on Monday, four traders told Reuters, putting the currency on track to open above its all-time low hit on Friday. Traders said that the RBI had likely stepped in the spot and non-deliverable forwards market to support the South Asian currency. Rupee @ 90? “The rupee may easily breach 90 in the absence of the RBI,” Ritesh Bhansali, deputy CEO at Mecklai Financial Services Ltd., told Bloomberg News, pointing to levels in the offshore market. He expected the central bank to step in at 90 to 90.50 per dollar to prevent a “free-fall” which might attract speculative trading. The rupee has declined 4.5% over the year so far and is among the worst-performing Asian currencies this year. Any further weakness might exacerbate outflows from local equities, while also posing future inflation risks as India is a net importer of fuel. Rupee in Unchartered Territory India's trade deficit widened to a record in October, with exports to the US plummeting a second straight month after the imposition of 50% tariffs. “On the back of a higher-than-expected trade deficit, net financial flows have been on the weaker side, thereby pressuring the rupee to depreciate while RBI had been containing the volatility,” wrote Yes Bank economists including Indranil Pan, in a note. With the rupee now in uncharted territory, predicting levels would be difficult, but the currency should be capped at 90 per dollar, they said. Following its recent currency market interventions, the RBI’s foreign-exchange reserves have dropped around $10 billion since mid-September, data released after trading hours on Friday showed.

      "description": "Ex-CIA officer James Lawler reveals explosive details about Pervez Musharraf’s reaction after being confronted with evidence that AQ Khan was selling nuclear secrets",
      "content": "Washington: Former CIA operations officer James Lawler, who led covert missions that penetrated and ultimately dismantled AQ Khan’s global nuclear trafficking network, has revealed dramatic new details of how Pakistan’s leadership reacted when confronted with evidence that its top nuclear scientist was selling state secrets. In an interview with ANI, Lawler said the turning point came when US intelligence presented “absolutely incontrovertible evidence” to Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf that Khan was illicitly trading nuclear technology abroad. Lawler recalled that then-CIA Director George Tenet directly told Musharraf that AQ Khan “was betraying Pakistan's nuclear secrets to at least the Libyans and maybe others,” triggering an explosive outburst. According to Lawler, Musharraf responded furiously, declaring, “I'm going to kill that son of a bitch.” Instead, Lawler said, Musharraf ultimately chose to place Khan under years-long house arrest — a move that became central to shutting down the proliferation network. Inside the CIA operation to sabotage the Khan network Lawler recounted that he was tasked in the mid-1990s with leading counter-proliferation operations in Europe before the CIA authorised him to “penetrate and sabotage” nuclear procurement chains. His small team created front companies posing as legitimate suppliers and used sting operations so that “the people came,” enabling the CIA to infiltrate the network from within. Studying historical covert actions convinced him that the most effective strategy was to mirror proliferators’ own methods. “If you want to defeat proliferation and proliferators, you need to become a proliferator,” he said. The team’s work, involving “no more than 10 people” at headquarters, ultimately exposed Khan’s transition into what Lawler called an “outward proliferator” selling nuclear expertise to foreign states. Lawler said he nicknamed Khan “the ‘Merchant of Death’.” A decisive breakthrough came with the interception of the BBC China, a freighter carrying containers packed with nuclear components intended for Libya. The evidence forced Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to acknowledge a secret nuclear programme. Sabotaging nuclear capability Lawler described the CIA’s strategy as a combination of intelligence gathering and technical disruption. “Harm” proliferators’ capability using scientific sabotage techniques developed with national laboratories. The stakes, he said, justified bold actions: “The risk of not acting would be the risk.” Looking ahead, Lawler expressed deep concern about Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, warning, “My biggest concern is the nuclear pandemic this would set off in the Middle East.” India–US ties: ‘compatible interests’ Lawler also urged the United States to strengthen its relationship with India. “I think sometimes American foreign policy is a big puzzle. What I am hopeful for is that the United States needs a much stronger relationship with India,” he opined. He questioned why the two nations, despite shared democratic values and converging interests, had never become true strategic partners. “You're a democracy. We're a democracy... I think we could be much stronger working together than standoffish,” he asked. He added that major frictions during Donald Trump’s presidency, including reciprocal tariffs and disputes over Russian oil imports, should not define the long-term partnership. Lawler served from 1980 to 2005 in multiple overseas roles. His nickname “Mad Dog” originated from a dog bite incident in France early in his career.",

      "content": "Barefoot Investor's warning to Australians worried about a stock market crash READ MORE: How much savings you should have based on your age By SARAH BROOKES - SENIOR REPORTER, AUSTRALIA Published: 22:24 EST, 23 November 2025 | Updated: 22:25 EST, 23 November 2025 e-mail View comments Barefoot Investor Scott Pape has warned a stock market crash will happen eventually. In his latest column, the Barefoot Investor paints a vivid picture of the moment many Australians dread. 'You wake up and check your phone. The markets have opened, and your super is down 25 per cent, $125,000 gone, just like that - what do you do?' Pape said he is constantly asked the same question in different 'apocalypse scenarios' - from a US debt default, to a global recession, to geopolitical conflict, to an AI-fuelled bubble bursting. 'Truthfully? Every investor has their own disaster movie playing in their head. 'The problem is you've created a story ... and it's almost certainly wrong. 'I know this because every story I've created has been wrong too.' Pape admitted he has made his own dire predictions in the past that failed to materialise. Scott Pape (pictured) says it's not a matter of if, but when the stock market will crash again 'I was convinced Trump's 18 per cent tariffs would skewer the world's largest economy. Didn't happen. 'I thought AI was overhyped by Silicon Valley grifters and would crash. Hasn't happened (yet).' Despite the uncertainty and fear that often grips global markets, Pape said he remains invested by sticking to a simple philosophy. 'My secret to investing is the same as my marriage: Low expectations and permanent paranoia.' He expects long-term returns of around 7 per cent after inflation, avoids whatever 'Wall Street is selling,' and stays loyal to index funds. He also keeps several years of living expenses in cash or fixed interest, a strategy that he said sacrifices returns but buys peace of mind. Turning back to the hypothetical scenario of a 25 per cent superannuation wipe-out, Pape said investors should ask themselves how they would react. 'Your answer to this question tells you everything about whether your portfolio is right for you, or a disaster waiting to happen. Does it make you want to panic and sell? 'If so, panic early. Talk to your super fund about reducing your exposure to the markets. 'Does it make you want to buy more shares on the cheap? 'Then you likely need more cash sitting ready to pounce when it happens. 'Look, the crash will come. It always does. The key to sleeping soundly is to open your eyes and live through it today.'

South Korea finalised this month a trade deal to reduce U.S. tariffs in return for large South Korean investments in U.S. strategic sectors, while Taiwan's trade negotiations are in progress. In the trade deal with South Korea, the US said semiconductor tariffs on the Asian country would be \"no less favourable than terms that may be offered in a future agreement covering a volume of semiconductor trade at least as large as South Korea's.\" That refers to key competitor Taiwan, South Korean officials have said. US officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centrepiece of Trump's economic agenda, Reuters reported last week. A South Korean official declined to confirm if there had been any specific discussion with Taiwan on the matter. South Korea's exports of semiconductors to the US rose 51.2% to $1.2 billion in October amid growing demand for advanced chips used for artificial intelligence, according to customs data.",

      "title": "These are the hottest gift items for 2025, as record holiday spending set in US",
      "description": "Despite doubts over economy, Americans set for record holiday spending",
      "content": "So what are the hot gift items for 2025? Experts say the new Nintendo Switch 2 game console and Apple's latest iPhone 17s will be popular, along with household appliances and home renovation items, even as economic uncertainty means Americans are less likely to move. Americans are expected to spend a record amount over the holiday season, despite lingering worries in the world's biggest economy about stubborn inflation, tariffs and the knock-on effects of the government shutdown. \"Consumers remain pretty concerned about inflation and, there's no doubt, about where prices are going,\" Mark Mathews, chief economist at the National Retail Federation (NRF), told reporters. For Mathews, the last time consumer confidence was so low -- apart from the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic -- dates back to the early 1980s. But, he added, \"over the past few years, we've seen consumers spend irrespective of how they're feeling about things.\" Rise in demand The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales -- from November 1 to December 31 -- to top $1 trillion for the first time, with growth of 3.7-4.2% as compared with last year. The record-setting 43-day government shutdown, which left hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and without a paycheck, triggered a decline in demand and in revenue for the private sector, but that situation is expected to quickly be reversed. President Donald Trump's sweeping on-off tariffs, however, could affect demand for certain products, although experts say competition should temper the effects of tariffs on consumers' wallets. \"We're seeing a deliberate and aggressive approach to avoid passing price increases onto the consumers,\" said NRF president Matt Shay. Competition, especially in online deals, should help avert a massive hike in prices. For buyers, competitive prices and free delivery are two key factors, Vivek Pandya, an analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, told AFP. The share of sales made online should increase this holiday season to $253.4 billion dollars, up 5.3 percent over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. A record $5 billion is expected to be spent per day over the 10 days that begins on \"Black Friday\" and runs through \"Cyber Week.\" 'Restraint' For Pandya, a 5.3 percent increase in online sales is \"actually pretty good\" given the variables and challenges in the US economy. He highlighted that sales in fact were up from October, when Amazon holds its major Prime Day sales. But the big day will certainly be Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, which is the traditional launch of the holiday shopping season -- and also when the best deals are to be had. That is followed by Cyber Monday, when online shopping takes center stage, especially on electronics and other tech. For Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist at the Conference Board business research organization, US consumers are remaining \"cautious\" and may approach gift purchases with some \"restraint\" after years of inflation-related belt-tightening. The Conference Board's annual survey revealed that Americans will spend an average of $990 on holiday-related purchases this year, down 6.9 percent from 2024. When adjusted for inflation, the figures are well under pre-pandemic spending. \"Consumers also said they are focused on giving their family and friends items they need this year rather than items they want,\" Guichard said in a statement. More and more Americans are also turning to \"buy now, pay later\" options to spread out the spending over several months. Shopping, AI style This year, artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini are gaining traction as a tool for consumers looking for the perfect gift or the best deals. In October, traffic to US retail websites from generative-AI sources spiked 1,200 percent year-on-year, and those web users were 16 percent more likely to buy something, according to Adobe Analytics. \"This indicates that with AI tools, shoppers are becoming more informed and able to pinpoint the most relevant retailers for their needs,\" Adobe said. Another shopping trend is \"social commerce,\" or selling products directly to consumers on social media platforms, often via posts made by influencers. \"Social commerce is incredibly important\" this year, Pandya told AFP. \"People are spending a lot of time on their mobile devices, a lot of time on social media apps (...) and these influencers have become very effective at providing really strong discount codes and perks for their audiences to spend.\"",

      "title": "How to hunt a duck curve",
      "description": "There has been a solar revolution in Pakistan, driven by lower solar panel prices and rising grid tariffs, creating a perfect recipe for a surge in solar additions.There have been two types of additions: net-metered and behind-the-meter. Net-metered additions are connected to the grid, in which the grid buys electricity from such customers at a price well above the prevailing marginal cost. Meanwhile, behind-the-meter refers to adding solar without grid connectivity. The emergence of both types has led to more than 25 GW of solar capacity available in the country, and this is expected to increase further.Due to such additions, Pakistan’s load curve has started to look very different from what our tariff design assumes, which is still stuck in the last century. As the sun rises, solar capacity kicks in from 7am to 3pm, reducing grid demand. It is during this same interval that the grid buys surplus electricity from net-metered customers, while the marginal price is at its lowest.Surplus supply during daylight hours reduces the marginal price of electricity. But due to a rigid and impractical tariff regime, the benefits cannot be captured, and a lower marginal price can not be passed on to consumers.Changing the tariff structure could allow an equilibrium price that mimics the actual demand-supply situation rather than one assumed in a silo somewhereBehind-the-meter solar and batteries are eating into daytime demand, and the existing cost-plus tariff is not designed to address it. The current tariff structure effectively divides all variable and fixed electricity costs across an assumed number of demand levels. This may have worked when there was no decentralised electricity generation, only till a few years back, but it does not work for an environment where decentralised generation continues to increase its share of the generation pie. It is important to pivot quickly to a subscription-style pricing model, where customers pay primarily for capacity and network, not just for units consumed, in the absence of which the system will keep raising tariffs for a shrinking base of kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales.Such sales will continue to contract as the share of decentralised generation increases, making the grid less tenable for all consumers and further accelerating migration from the grid. That is a recipe for faster grid defection, more behind-the-meter investment, and a larger circular debt stock.The grid is increasingly full at night and in the evening, but hollowed out in the middle of the day. That valley during the middle of the day is a classic “duck curve”, which entails high demand at the shoulders of the day, a pronounced dip when solar is strongest, and then a steep evening ramp when solar output collapses and everyone turns lights, motors and air conditioners back on. The system is paying for capacity it cannot use in the middle of the day, and then scrambling to recover fixed costs from fewer units sold.On the storage side, lithium-battery import data suggests that by mid-2025, Pakistan will already be sitting on roughly 18 GWh of stationary energy storage. As battery prices continue to decline, battery storage is expected to reach more than 75 GWh by 2028, further risking defection from the grid.Consumers do not need to completely move away from the grid; every minute or kWh they use either decentralised generation or a battery is a minute or kWh taken away from the grid, which means lower grid utilisation and, inadvertently, higher prices for everyone else. It is important to look at things at the margin here, to identify the inflection point, rather than using a simple average that masks distortions.Based on current trends, we will soon have the technical ability to mobilise 7–15 GW of flexible, distributed capacity for two hours during peak times, if even a fraction of these batteries are aggregated and dispatched as part of micro-grids or virtual power plants.If tariff design does not respond, the load curve will become more extreme, resulting in deeper midday troughs, sharper evening ramps, and progressively lower utilisation of grid-supplied energy per rupee of fixed cost locked into the system. The existing tariff philosophy still behaves as if fixed and variable costs are recovered primarily through per-kWh charges. Total power payments are estimated at Rs3.5 trillion, of which the power purchase price is about Rs3.1tr. Within this, capacity charges alone are roughly Rs1.8tr, just over half of the entire system’s revenue requirement. These are obligations Pakistan must pay, whether grid sales are 120 terawatt-hour (TWh) or 90 TWh.Dividing this over a lower denominator spells disaster for all consumers, or even taxpayers in the process, since any policy disaster is eventually funded by the taxpayer, either through higher taxes, or by the population, through higher inflation.Instead of recovering capacity, network and social-policy costs inside an opaque energy rate, the tariff must be unbundled into three transparent components.Firstly, a capacity subscription (CS), which refers to a fixed rupee-per-kWh monthly charge that recovers generation capacity costs. Secondly, a network charge (NC), which can be a fixed rupee-per-kWh per month that recovers transmission and distribution costs.

      "content": "There has been a solar revolution in Pakistan, driven by lower solar panel prices and rising grid tariffs, creating a perfect recipe for a surge in solar additions.There have been two types of additions: net-metered and behind-the-meter. Net-metered additions are connected to the grid, in which the grid buys electricity from such customers at a price well above the prevailing marginal cost. Meanwhile, behind-the-meter refers to adding solar without grid connectivity. The emergence of both types has led to more than 25 GW of solar capacity available in the country, and this is expected to increase further.Due to such additions, Pakistan’s load curve has started to look very different from what our tariff design assumes, which is still stuck in the last century. As the sun rises, solar capacity kicks in from 7am to 3pm, reducing grid demand. It is during this same interval that the grid buys surplus electricity from net-metered customers, while the marginal price is at its lowest.Surplus supply during daylight hours reduces the marginal price of electricity. But due to a rigid and impractical tariff regime, the benefits cannot be captured, and a lower marginal price can not be passed on to consumers.Changing the tariff structure could allow an equilibrium price that mimics the actual demand-supply situation rather than one assumed in a silo somewhereBehind-the-meter solar and batteries are eating into daytime demand, and the existing cost-plus tariff is not designed to address it. The current tariff structure effectively divides all variable and fixed electricity costs across an assumed number of demand levels. This may have worked when there was no decentralised electricity generation, only till a few years back, but it does not work for an environment where decentralised generation continues to increase its share of the generation pie. It is important to pivot quickly to a subscription-style pricing model, where customers pay primarily for capacity and network, not just for units consumed, in the absence of which the system will keep raising tariffs for a shrinking base of kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales.Such sales will continue to contract as the share of decentralised generation increases, making the grid less tenable for all consumers and further accelerating migration from the grid. That is a recipe for faster grid defection, more behind-the-meter investment, and a larger circular debt stock.The grid is increasingly full at night and in the evening, but hollowed out in the middle of the day. That valley during the middle of the day is a classic “duck curve”, which entails high demand at the shoulders of the day, a pronounced dip when solar is strongest, and then a steep evening ramp when solar output collapses and everyone turns lights, motors and air conditioners back on. The system is paying for capacity it cannot use in the middle of the day, and then scrambling to recover fixed costs from fewer units sold.On the storage side, lithium-battery import data suggests that by mid-2025, Pakistan will already be sitting on roughly 18 GWh of stationary energy storage. As battery prices continue to decline, battery storage is expected to reach more than 75 GWh by 2028, further risking defection from the grid.Consumers do not need to completely move away from the grid; every minute or kWh they use either decentralised generation or a battery is a minute or kWh taken away from the grid, which means lower grid utilisation and, inadvertently, higher prices for everyone else. It is important to look at things at the margin here, to identify the inflection point, rather than using a simple average that masks distortions.Based on current trends, we will soon have the technical ability to mobilise 7–15 GW of flexible, distributed capacity for two hours during peak times, if even a fraction of these batteries are aggregated and dispatched as part of micro-grids or virtual power plants.If tariff design does not respond, the load curve will become more extreme, resulting in deeper midday troughs, sharper evening ramps, and progressively lower utilisation of grid-supplied energy per rupee of fixed cost locked into the system. The existing tariff philosophy still behaves as if fixed and variable costs are recovered primarily through per-kWh charges. Total power payments are estimated at Rs3.5 trillion, of which the power purchase price is about Rs3.1tr. Within this, capacity charges alone are roughly Rs1.8tr, just over half of the entire system’s revenue requirement. These are obligations Pakistan must pay, whether grid sales are 120 terawatt-hour (TWh) or 90 TWh.Dividing this over a lower denominator spells disaster for all consumers, or even taxpayers in the process, since any policy disaster is eventually funded by the taxpayer, either through higher taxes, or by the population, through higher inflation.Instead of recovering capacity, network and social-policy costs inside an opaque energy rate, the tariff must be unbundled into three transparent components.Firstly, a capacity subscription (CS), which refers to a fixed rupee-per-kWh monthly charge that recovers generation capacity costs. Secondly, a network charge (NC), which can be a fixed rupee-per-kWh per month that recovers transmission and distribution costs. And lastly, an energy charge, which can be a rupee-per-kWh rate that tracks the system’s shortrun marginal cost (SRMC) and varies by time of day.Moving to a marginal cost regime will eventually lead to an equilibrium price that mimics the actual demand-supply situation rather than one assumed in a silo somewhere.The economic logic is straightforward: CS and NC are billed on the higher of the sanctioned load or the measured maximum demand.

It features reciprocal tariff reductions, particularly benefiting Pakistani exports such as textiles, leather goods, surgical instruments, and agricultural products, while Pakistan rolled back its digital services tax.Earlier, on Aug 1, Pakistan announced that the US had imposed a 19 per cent tariff on its exports — a reduction from the 29pc rate announced by President Donald Trump in April.The revised rate was described by Islamabad as a “balanced and forward-looking step” aimed at enhancing Pakistan’s competitiveness in the American market.In contrast, India initially faced a 26pc “reciprocal” tariff on April 9, which was later raised to 50pc by an executive order on Aug 6, effective since Aug 27, citing India’s purchases of Russian oil.The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in Washington cautions that the 2025 reciprocal tariffs may reduce both US and global economic growth while boosting inflation in affected economies.

      "description": "Driven by a growing trade deficit, Pakistan’s current account has widened rapidly in recent months, which has raised concerns over the sustainability of the country’s external position going forward. As imports continue to fast outpace stagnant exports significantly, the pressure is mounting on the home currency.The State Bank appears cognisant of the situation and has tightened restrictions on individual dollar purchases from the open market. Yet, the widening imbalance — in spite of robust remittances keeping the market liquid — has strengthened market expectations that the rupee would eventually have to adjust, the central bank’s efforts to maintain stability through administrative and monetary measures notwithstanding.In this context, the sharp slide of the Indian rupee in recent months is proving to be an important external anchor, sharpening focus on regional competitiveness and heightening worries that Pakistan’s currency may be becoming overvalued.India’s rupee has struggled for three months since high US tariffs — among the steepest on any Asian nation — on Indian exports took effect in late August. Even as the country’s economic fundamentals remain resilient and equity markets hover near record highs, the tariffs have pushed India’s merchandise trade deficit to a record level, with exports to the US down nine per cent year-on-year.‘It took us 15–20 years to build a competitive interbank market, which we have destroyed by managing the exchange rate’The Indian currency is down by 4.3pc versus the dollar this year, sliding by 0.9pc on Friday to a lifetime low of 89.48, surpassing the previous record low of 88.8 in September, as the Reserve Bank of India pulled back its support for the currency.Pakistani exporters are now increasingly anxious about currency devaluation, arguing that it is necessary to maintain their competitiveness in international markets. To support their argument for currency devaluation, many insist that they risk losing market share unless the rupee also finds a lower equilibrium, with India allowing its currency to weaken.Pakistan’s current account deficit has widened to $733 million in the first four months of the current financial year, nearly 3.5 times higher than the $206m deficit recorded in the same period last year, according to the latest balance of payments data from the SBP. The pressure on the current account is coming directly from rising imports as the central bank relaxed curbs under the International Monetary Fund directives and growth quickens. Exports continue to stagnate because of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to what exporters term a “managed exchange rate”.The Indian currency is down by 4.3pc versus the dollar this year, sliding by 0.9pc on Friday to a lifetime low of 89.48Imports have surged 10 per cent to $24.92 billion in 4MFY26 from $22.65bn in 4MFY25, while exports increased 4.8pc to $13.66bn compared to $13.04bn a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit in goods and services has expanded to $11.26bn from $9.61bn a year ago.That the current account gap continues to widen in spite of robust growth in workers’ remittances, which increased 9.3pc to $12.96bn in 4MFY26 from $11.85bn during the same period last year, underscores that this trend could intensify going forward unless imports are restricted and exports pushed. A further deterioration in the fragile external sector would bring more pressure on the rupee.More curbs on imports are likely to fetch severe public criticism, as the government is already blamed for failing to boost economic growth over the last three years. Many argue that the government has deliberately cut GDP growth to keep the current account under control. The government achieved a surplus of $1.9bn last year, but growth stagnated at 3pc.The recent trajectory of the current account underscores how vulnerable Pakistan’s external position remains to swings in global commodity prices, which inflate the import bill, and to the performance of workers’ remittances, the country’s most reliable source of foreign exchange. In FY22, a steep widening of the deficit depleted foreign exchange reserves, triggered a balance-of-payments crisis and forced renewed engagement with the International Monetary Fund.The subsequent reduction of the deficit in FY23 and the modest gap in FY24 were largely the result of policy-driven measures, most notably stringent import controls that helped compress demand but also dampened economic growth and killed industrial activity. Last year’s surplus was primarily due to record-high remittance inflows, controlled imports and stronger information technology and telecom exports, which together offset the persistent deficit in goods trade.Analysts argue that the core problem is structural: Pakistan consumes far more than it produces. “Pakistan’s structural weaknesses, primarily its heavy dependence on imports and a chronically weak export base, have historically kept the current account in deficit,” a banker noted. “The growing deficit mirrors a deeper vulnerability: we are a country trapped in a debt cycle, where we borrow to finance consumption and then borrow again to repay those loans.” Textile exporters share this view. “The way forward requires a decisive shift toward a productivity-led, export-oriented growth model. That means redirecting incentives toward production and exports. Pakistan needs a productivity revolution to build a competitive, export-driven economy,” said an exporter from Faisalabad. But he added that such a transformation requires consistent policies sustained over several years. “While we move in this direction, we must align our exchange rate with our industrial competitiveness to protect our existing exports for now.”Another major textile exporter was sharply critical of the government and the SBP for “artificially managing the exchange rate”. He lamented, “It took us 15–20 years to build a competitive interbank market, which we have destroyed by managing the exchange rate. How come all banks quote the same rate unless the exchange rate is being managed?”He rejected the claim that the exchange rate has little bearing on export competitiveness. “Undoubtedly, a sudden major spurt of devaluation after a period of managed exchange rate does not help; rather, it hurts the economy, as we have seen since the early 2000s.

      "content": "Driven by a growing trade deficit, Pakistan’s current account has widened rapidly in recent months, which has raised concerns over the sustainability of the country’s external position going forward. As imports continue to fast outpace stagnant exports significantly, the pressure is mounting on the home currency.The State Bank appears cognisant of the situation and has tightened restrictions on individual dollar purchases from the open market. Yet, the widening imbalance — in spite of robust remittances keeping the market liquid — has strengthened market expectations that the rupee would eventually have to adjust, the central bank’s efforts to maintain stability through administrative and monetary measures notwithstanding.In this context, the sharp slide of the Indian rupee in recent months is proving to be an important external anchor, sharpening focus on regional competitiveness and heightening worries that Pakistan’s currency may be becoming overvalued.India’s rupee has struggled for three months since high US tariffs — among the steepest on any Asian nation — on Indian exports took effect in late August. Even as the country’s economic fundamentals remain resilient and equity markets hover near record highs, the tariffs have pushed India’s merchandise trade deficit to a record level, with exports to the US down nine per cent year-on-year.‘It took us 15–20 years to build a competitive interbank market, which we have destroyed by managing the exchange rate’The Indian currency is down by 4.3pc versus the dollar this year, sliding by 0.9pc on Friday to a lifetime low of 89.48, surpassing the previous record low of 88.8 in September, as the Reserve Bank of India pulled back its support for the currency.Pakistani exporters are now increasingly anxious about currency devaluation, arguing that it is necessary to maintain their competitiveness in international markets. To support their argument for currency devaluation, many insist that they risk losing market share unless the rupee also finds a lower equilibrium, with India allowing its currency to weaken.Pakistan’s current account deficit has widened to $733 million in the first four months of the current financial year, nearly 3.5 times higher than the $206m deficit recorded in the same period last year, according to the latest balance of payments data from the SBP. The pressure on the current account is coming directly from rising imports as the central bank relaxed curbs under the International Monetary Fund directives and growth quickens. Exports continue to stagnate because of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to what exporters term a “managed exchange rate”.The Indian currency is down by 4.3pc versus the dollar this year, sliding by 0.9pc on Friday to a lifetime low of 89.48Imports have surged 10 per cent to $24.92 billion in 4MFY26 from $22.65bn in 4MFY25, while exports increased 4.8pc to $13.66bn compared to $13.04bn a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit in goods and services has expanded to $11.26bn from $9.61bn a year ago.That the current account gap continues to widen in spite of robust growth in workers’ remittances, which increased 9.3pc to $12.96bn in 4MFY26 from $11.85bn during the same period last year, underscores that this trend could intensify going forward unless imports are restricted and exports pushed. A further deterioration in the fragile external sector would bring more pressure on the rupee.More curbs on imports are likely to fetch severe public criticism, as the government is already blamed for failing to boost economic growth over the last three years. Many argue that the government has deliberately cut GDP growth to keep the current account under control. The government achieved a surplus of $1.9bn last year, but growth stagnated at 3pc.The recent trajectory of the current account underscores how vulnerable Pakistan’s external position remains to swings in global commodity prices, which inflate the import bill, and to the performance of workers’ remittances, the country’s most reliable source of foreign exchange. In FY22, a steep widening of the deficit depleted foreign exchange reserves, triggered a balance-of-payments crisis and forced renewed engagement with the International Monetary Fund.The subsequent reduction of the deficit in FY23 and the modest gap in FY24 were largely the result of policy-driven measures, most notably stringent import controls that helped compress demand but also dampened economic growth and killed industrial activity. Last year’s surplus was primarily due to record-high remittance inflows, controlled imports and stronger information technology and telecom exports, which together offset the persistent deficit in goods trade.Analysts argue that the core problem is structural: Pakistan consumes far more than it produces. “Pakistan’s structural weaknesses, primarily its heavy dependence on imports and a chronically weak export base, have historically kept the current account in deficit,” a banker noted. “The growing deficit mirrors a deeper vulnerability: we are a country trapped in a debt cycle, where we borrow to finance consumption and then borrow again to repay those loans.” Textile exporters share this view. “The way forward requires a decisive shift toward a productivity-led, export-oriented growth model. That means redirecting incentives toward production and exports. Pakistan needs a productivity revolution to build a competitive, export-driven economy,” said an exporter from Faisalabad. But he added that such a transformation requires consistent policies sustained over several years. “While we move in this direction, we must align our exchange rate with our industrial competitiveness to protect our existing exports for now.”Another major textile exporter was sharply critical of the government and the SBP for “artificially managing the exchange rate”. He lamented, “It took us 15–20 years to build a competitive interbank market, which we have destroyed by managing the exchange rate. How come all banks quote the same rate unless the exchange rate is being managed?”He rejected the claim that the exchange rate has little bearing on export competitiveness. “Undoubtedly, a sudden major spurt of devaluation after a period of managed exchange rate does not help; rather, it hurts the economy, as we have seen since the early 2000s. Each period of managed exchange was followed by rounds of major devaluations, leading to hyperinflation and expensive raw material imports, and all this happened after our exporters had already lost market share internationally. Currency devaluation works only if it follows a gradual and natural course.”According to him, the government has limited options if it intends to keep the rupee “stable” at its present level without eroding export competitiveness further: interest rates would need to be slashed to 5–6pc from the current 11pc, and energy prices for exporters would have to fall substantially.“The government and the central bank can manage the current account and the exchange rate as long as remittances keep growing. But they cannot protect goods and services exports by maintaining a lid on the exchange rate. The sooner this lid is lifted, the better, because the exchange rate has to adjust sooner or later. The longer it takes, the more damaging it will be for the economy and exports both.”Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, November 24th, 2025",

      "content": "India's seafood sector is diversifying beyond the US due to high tariffs. Shrimp exports grew 18% to USD 2.43 billion in 5MFY26, with non-US markets like Vietnam and China driving 86% of the incremental value, a CareEdge report noted. India's seafood sector is gradually expanding its global market reach beyond its traditional dependence on the United States, as exporters diversify to counter the impact of rising tariffs. Shrimp exports recorded strong growth during the first five months of FY26, supported primarily by demand from non-US markets, including Vietnam, Belgium, China and Russia, a report by CareEdge Ratings highlighted. It stated \"India's seafood sector is gradually broadening its market presence beyond traditional markets like the USA\". Shrimp Export Growth in FY26 According to the report, shrimp exports grew significantly in 5MFY26, with the total export value rising 18 per cent year-on-year to USD 2.43 billion. This growth came alongside an 11 per cent increase in shipment volumes, which reached 3.48 lakh metric tonnes (LMT). Much of the momentum was driven by non-US markets, which accounted for 86 per cent of the incremental export value. Exports to non-US destinations surged 30 per cent year-on-year to USD 1.38 billion during the first five months of FY26 (5MFY26), compared to USD 1.06 billion in the same period last year. The shift reflects a strategic expansion by Indian exporters into newer and previously less accessible global markets. As a result, the share of non-US markets in total shrimp exports increased from 51 per cent in 5MFY25 to 57 per cent in 5MFY26. US Tariff Pressure Spurs Diversification The report also added that a rise in non-US exports has helped cushion the pressure emerging from the US market, where Indian shrimp has faced sharply higher tariffs since early FY26. Between April and August 2025, the effective tariff on Indian shrimp shipments to the US averaged around 18 per cent, compared with 13-14 per cent for key competitors Ecuador and Indonesia. Post-August, effective duties on Indian shrimp surged to nearly 58 per cent, while competing nations faced duties between 18-49 per cent. Among non-US destinations, China remained the largest buyer, with exports rising 16 per cent. Japan, which earlier functioned primarily as a reprocessing market, maintained stable levels. Vietnam's role as a re-export hub strengthened, as exports doubled to USD 0.18 billion. Exports to Belgium also doubled to USD 0.14 billion, driven by improved demand from the European Union and stronger compliance with traceability requirements by Indian exporters. Future Outlook The report noted that while export momentum may soften in the second half of FY26 due to continued pressure from the US market and weaker fresh orders, efforts to open access to new markets and increased approvals for Indian units exporting to the EU and Russia are expected to support the industry.

      "description": "Job growth in September exceeded expectations, but overall employment has shown little change since April. With net immigration projected to be near zero or negative, low job growth may become the new normal. This shift, driven by restrictive immigration policies, could redefine a healthy labor market.",
      "content": "The latest jobs report, delayed for almost seven weeks by the government shutdown, finally came out on Thursday and we learned that job growth in September exceeded expectations -- coming in at 119,000 net new jobs, an improvement on August, which saw a net loss. The White House took the occasion to celebrate. But the summary provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics juxtaposed the news with another key piece of information, noting, \"employment edged up by 119,000 in September but has shown little change since April.\" Indeed, employment growth from May to September averaged just under 40,000 new jobs per month, which gives us a better indication of the employment picture: Right now, job growth is low. Given President Trump's immigration crackdown and the attendant decline in net immigration, we need to start thinking about low job growth as the new normal. Let me explain: Net immigration in 2025 is on track to be close to zero or even negative -- more people will probably end up leaving the United States than entering for the first time in decades. Fewer immigrants overall means fewer immigrants entering the work force and fewer immigrants spending money. We're conditioned to think that job growth of 40,000 a month is a terrible omen for our economy -- a sickly labor market or a sign of an impending recession. But if Mr. Trump's restrictive immigration policies continue, it might simply be what the sustainable pace of new employment looks like. The monthly new-jobs number doesn't mean a whole lot on its own. For it to tell us whether employment growth is weak, healthy or overheated, we have to compare it with the number of job seekers. If we have sustainable employment growth combined with a low unemployment rate, it tells us that the labor market is healthy: When the number of new jobs created is roughly in sync with the number of new job seekers, overall, employees' wages should grow fast enough to increase their purchasing power but not so fast as to create unwanted inflation. The sustainable pace of job growth just before the Covid-19 pandemic was about 100,000 new jobs a month by my calculations, lower than in prior years as more people reached retirement age. The post-pandemic surge in immigration changed all that; from 2022 to 2024, the estimated sustainable pace was around 200,000 per month as the influx of immigrants (often with temporary work permits) joined the labor force. Current immigration policy seems to have thrown that into reverse. Over the next year, then, a healthy job market will probably mean a low unemployment rate of 4 to 4.5 percent (which is where we've been since early 2024) and job creation that hovers around the current pace. In July, Stan Veuger, Tara Watson and I published an analysis projecting that by 2027, the sustainable pace of net new jobs could fall to as low as negative 10,000, meaning fewer jobs each month than the month before. Proponents of Mr. Trump's approach to immigration tend to see it differently. Last year, then-Senator JD Vance essentially argued that fewer immigrants would lead to more job openings for native-born job seekers, particularly men, and that the resulting increase in wages would entice more native-born men to join the ranks of job seekers. But I have my doubts. Empirical analyses suggest that reductions in immigration bring little change to the wages of native-born workers with skills similar to those of the immigrants who would otherwise be doing the same work. The percentage of native-born men between the ages of 25 and 54 in the job market has shown a long downward trend since 1960, with periods of strong wage growth doing little more than temporarily slowing the decline. It was easy to predict that Mr. Trump's immigration policies would reduce the number of people looking for work. What wasn't always fully considered was that the choking-off of immigration would reduce labor demand as well: The immigrants who aren't here because of Mr. Trump's policies not only aren't working here; they're also not spending money here. When consumer demand for goods and services diminishes, business owners don't need to hire as many people. No doubt, the costs and uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's tariff policies have also led businesses to hire fewer people. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, has said that the labor market is in a \"curious kind of balance.\" It is remarkable that the number of available new jobs has come down almost in tandem with the drop in the number of available new workers. (This is not the case in every community and every sector; surely there are construction companies having trouble staffing their crews.) Some Fed officials and other observers have worried that if the pace of job creation loses too much steam, it could tip the labor market into weakness and push the unemployment rate higher. Indeed, it made sense that the Fed stepped in to prevent that by modestly lowering interest rates. Nonetheless, consider the flip side. In a world where the demand for new workers by employers remained at 2024 levels but the number of job seekers fell abruptly because of immigration policy, the Fed would have needed to either cool an overheated labor market or risk a situation where rising wages added to inflationary pressure. If we're finding out that restricted immigration combined with high and ever-changing tariffs in fact reduced the overall need for labor, then those policies did the work that the Fed would have otherwise had to do. Again, a good outcome in this economic environment will consist of a low unemployment rate with low or no employment growth. This will be something new for many Americans, who understandably connect a healthy job market with higher monthly jobs numbers. A healthy job market, however, doesn't necessarily mean a thriving economy. A smaller population resulting from lower immigration means a smaller economy well into the future. On top of that, more restrictive immigration means fewer working-age immigrants paying taxes, even as many of them wait years to get most federal benefits (or never become eligible for them). Finally, economists link immigration to productivity growth. In other words, making America less hospitable to immigrants will eventually make America poorer.",

South Korea finalised this month a trade deal to reduce U.S. tariffs in return for large South Korean investments in U.S. strategic sectors, while Taiwan's trade negotiations are in progress. In the trade deal with South Korea, the U.S. said semiconductor tariffs on the Asian country would be \"no less favourable than terms that may be offered in a future agreement covering a volume of semiconductor trade at least as large as South Korea's.\" That refers to key competitor Taiwan, South Korean officials have said. U.S. officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centrepiece of Trump's economic agenda, Reuters reported last week. A South Korean official declined to confirm if there had been any specific discussion with Taiwan on the matter. South Korea's exports of semiconductors to the U.S. rose 51.2% to $1.2 billion in October amid growing demand for advanced chips used for artificial intelligence, according to customs data.

      "description": "China has launched a global mining initiative with friendly nations in response to US efforts to create an alternative rare earth supply chain.",
      "content": "Amid global concerns over minerals export curbs, China introduced a global mining initiative with “friendly nations,” an indirect response to US efforts to rally allies for an alternative rare earth supply chain, Bloomberg reported. The development comes as European leaders deal with supply chain issues and Global South countries appeal for assistance in benefiting from a rising industry where Beijing leads in processing. The US and its allies have been scrambling to establish an alternative supply chain for super-strong rare earth magnets. China aims to“promote mutually beneficial cooperation and peaceful use of key minerals,” China’s Premier Li Qiang was quoted as saying by the new agency. He further pledged that his country would “safeguard the interests of developing countries, while prudently addressing military and other uses.” China's mineral export plan In the press briefing as the summit wrapped, China shared details of the initiative with 19 nations, including resource-rich Cambodia, Nigeria, Myanmar and Zimbabwe, along with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. However, Beijing did not share any financial details of the initiative, the report said. The proposal aims to establish an inclusive network to ensure the “fair and reasonable, stable and smooth” mining of critical minerals, according to Chinese state media. Critical minerals were a key theme at the G20 summit in South Africa this weekend. Even before discussions started, the G20 subtly criticised China in a joint declaration, highlighting “unilateral trade actions” that limit access to critical minerals, an ongoing challenge for manufacturing countries such as Germany and Japan. China's justification for export curbs In a speech on Sunday, Li justified the need to “cautiously manage” exports of minerals critical for military use, laying out China’s rationale for its sweeping curbs. President Xi Jinping has leveraged China’s control over rare earths, crucial for manufacturing everything from missiles to mobile phones, to protect the country’s economy from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Beijing's rare earth regulations, first introduced in April and expanded in October, require exporters to secure licenses for each cargo. These restrictions caused shortages in May, halting parts of the auto industry. European nations have been significantly impacted by China’s decision to require export licenses for metals with military applications. Leaders from France, Germany, the UK, and Ireland are scheduled to travel to China in the coming months, with discussions likely focusing on access to rare earths. China and the US are continuing to finalise negotiations for issuing “general licenses” that would allow the free flow of rare earths. This comes after Xi reached a trade truce with Trump last month, a deal Trump described as benefiting the entire world. (With inputs from agencies.)",

      "description": "Michael Loscheller, CEO of electric vehicle brand Polestar, highlighted the strategic value of the company’s Busan plant and named Korea as a core pillar of its global operations.Michael Loscheller, Polestar CEO / Polestar KoreaAt a press conference held at “Polestar Seoul Space” in Hannam, Seoul on the 20th, CEO Loscheller said, “The Busan plant is the North American supply base for the Polestar 4 and a hub that can connect to various markets in the future,” adding, “Its role is clear even amid changes in the global supply chain and the regulatory environment for electric vehicles.” He continued, “It will continue to serve as a strategic base going forward.”He added, “Two weeks ago, I visited Canada and saw the first Polestar 4s produced in Busan arrive in the North American region,” stressing that “the Busan plant will remain a key production base that supplies vehicles stably to the North American market.”When asked about the possibility of additional investment in Korea, he took a cautious stance. Regarding whether Polestar would establish an R&D center or design hub in Korea, Loscheller said, “We need to cross the bridge after thoroughly testing it,” adding, “Since North American consumers are very demanding about quality and competition is fierce, achieving success in the region with vehicles produced in Busan comes first.” He noted that “once that success is assured, new opportunities may be explored.”He also dismissed speculation that Polestar is using the Busan plant primarily to avoid tariffs. After the U.S. recently imposed a 245% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles, some raised the interpretation that Polestar’s reliance on the Busan plant was a tariff-avoidance strategy. CEO Loscheller said, “Tariffs may be one factor, but our decision reflects a comprehensive judgment that includes cost efficiency, production experience, and many other elements,” rejecting that interpretation.Regarding brand strategy, he emphasized Scandinavian design typical of Sweden, high-performance DNA rooted in motorsports, and sustainability as Polestar’s core values. “Beyond environmental value, Polestar has strong appeal in terms of driving enjoyment,” he said.Polestar 4 / Polestar KoreaHe also gave a positive assessment of the Korean market’s growth. “From January to November this year, sales in Korea increased by about 251% compared to the same period last year,” Loscheller said, calling the performance “very encouraging.” He cited the Polestar 4 as the main driver of strong sales, noting that it is “optimized for the Korean market in design, performance, and price competitiveness.” He added that the efforts of Polestar Korea and its dealers, along with brand-experience spaces such as Seoul Space, created strong synergy.The company plans to launch the new Polestar 3 and Polestar 5 in Korea in 2026. “Both models will play important roles in strengthening the brand’s presence,” he said confidently. Regarding the Polestar 5 in particular, he noted, “It accelerates from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in just 3.2 seconds,” describing it as “a high-performance EV suitable for the Korean market that combines everyday usability, spaciousness, and performance.” He also indicated that the model will compete on inherent brand values—Scandinavian design, performance, and sustainability—rather than price.On the service network, he said Polestar benefits from collaboration with Volvo. “Being able to use Volvo’s service network as-is greatly helps build consumer trust,” Loscheller explained. “There are about 39 Volvo service centers in Korea, which helps ease concerns consumers may have about a new brand.” He emphasized that “Volvo, as a key partner and shareholder, is a trusted presence in both technology and service.”“Korea is a very important market for us,” Loscheller said, adding, “Based on our solid growth, we will become a brand that Korean customers can rely on.”ih.heo@chosunbiz.com",

After the U.S. recently imposed a 245% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles, some raised the interpretation that Polestar’s reliance on the Busan plant was a tariff-avoidance strategy. CEO Loscheller said, “Tariffs may be one factor, but our decision reflects a comprehensive judgment that includes cost efficiency, production experience, and many other elements,” rejecting that interpretation. Regarding brand strategy, he emphasized Scandinavian design typical of Sweden, high-performance DNA rooted in motorsports, and sustainability as Polestar’s core values. “Beyond environmental value, Polestar has strong appeal in terms of driving enjoyment,” he said. He also gave a positive assessment of the Korean market’s growth. “From January to November this year, sales in Korea increased by about 251% compared to the same period last year,” Loscheller said, calling the performance “very encouraging.” He cited the Polestar 4 as the main driver of strong sales, noting that it is “optimized for the Korean market in design, performance, and price competitiveness.” He added that the efforts of Polestar Korea and its dealers, along with brand-experience spaces such as Seoul Space, created strong synergy. The company plans to launch the new Polestar 3 and Polestar 5 in Korea in 2026. “Both models will play important roles in strengthening the brand’s presence,” he said confidently. Regarding the Polestar 5 in particular, he noted, “It accelerates from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in just 3.2 seconds,” describing it as “a high-performance EV suitable for the Korean market that combines everyday usability, spaciousness, and performance.” He also indicated that the model will compete on inherent brand values—Scandinavian design, performance, and sustainability—rather than price. On the service network, he said Polestar benefits from collaboration with Volvo. “Being able to use Volvo’s service network as-is greatly helps build consumer trust,” Loscheller explained. “There are about 39 Volvo service centers in Korea, which helps ease concerns consumers may have about a new brand.” He emphasized that “Volvo, as a key partner and shareholder, is a trusted presence in both technology and service.” “Korea is a very important market for us,” Loscheller said, adding, “Based on our solid growth, we will become a brand that Korean customers can rely on.” ih.heo@chosunbiz.com",

European and African leaders gather in Angola Monday for a summit aimed at deepening economic and security ties that will serve as a backdrop to emergency talks on Ukraine. France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Kenya's William Ruto are among dozens of European Union and African leaders expected in Luanda amid a US-European rift over a Washington plan to end the Ukraine conflict. Talks with African nations will centre on trade, migration and critical raw materials. But EU minds will in part be focused on efforts to push back at a draft plan by US President Donald Trump to stop Russia's war in Ukraine, proposals initially seen as heavily tilted in favour of Moscow. After top US and Ukrainian representatives met in Geneva on Sunday for talks on a new version of the proposal, EU leaders were to hold a \"special meeting\" on the sidelines of the Luanda gathering on Monday. Read also S.Africa G20 declaration highlights: minerals, debt, climate There is \"still a lot of work to be done on the 28-point plan\", Finnish President Alexander Stubb told AFP in Johannesburg on Sunday. ATTENTION: Protect Yourself From Fake News — Learn How In Our Free Short Course. Get a Certificate! 'Credible commitments' The seventh gathering of its kind, the two-day Angola summit comes on the heels of a G20 meeting in South Africa where a US boycott underscored geopolitical fractures. It marks 25 years of EU-African Union relations -- ties that analysts say need revamping if Europe wants to hold on to its role as the continent's top partner. Africa has emerged as a renewed diplomatic battleground, with China, the United States and Russia competing for its minerals, energy potential and political support. The EU is the leading supplier of foreign direct investment to the continent and its leading commercial counterpart. Trade in goods and services hit 467 billion euros ($538 billion) in 2023, according to Brussels. Yet it has suffered setbacks, at times fuelled by resentment at the West's colonial past, with China securing strategic resources in some countries and Russia taking over as preferred security partner in others. Read also G20 summit opens in South Africa without Trump The Gulf states and Turkey have also made significant inroads, granting African nations choice and bargaining power vis-a-vis the EU, said Geert Laporte of ECDPM, a European think tank. \"We don't have that situation anymore where Europe was the only partner,\" he said. EU capitals now need to come up with an \"offer that is attractive enough to beat\" the competition, he added. That would require investments in infrastructure, energy and industrial projects that generate employment and economic growth in Africa -- and a move away from lofty statements of support, observers say. \"Africa is looking not for new declarations but for credible, implementable commitments,\" said AU spokesman Nuur Mohamud Sheekh. Minerals and credibility Tackling illegal migration to Europe and security cooperation are on the agenda, as is a diplomatic push to grant Africa a stronger voice in global governance bodies. But boosting trade will likely be the top priority, as US tariffs buffet both continents. Read also EU to seek more tariff exemptions during US commerce secretary visit The EU is expected to offer its expertise to help build up intra-African trade, which currently accounts for a paltry 15 percent of the total, diplomats said. It will also seek to secure critical minerals needed for its green transition and ease its dependency on China for rare earths, essential for tech and electronic goods. The 27-nation bloc will likely showcase new investments under the Global Gateway -- a massive infrastructure plan that Brussels hopes can counter China's growing influence. Summit-host Angola is home to one of the EU initiative's signature undertakings: the Lobito corridor, a railway project funded in partnership with the United States to connect mineral-rich areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to the Atlantic coast. EU diplomats have been at pains to present such projects as win-wins but critics retort that the scheme repeats some extractive colonial practices and has yet to deliver significant improvements for local communities. \"Investment must move from PowerPoint to the factory floor,\" said Ikemesit Effiong, of the Nigeria-based consultancy SBM Intelligence. \"Europe's credibility now depends on whether it can support the delivery of projects that create value in Africa, not just visibility for Brussels.\" PAY ATTENTION: Follow our WhatsApp channel to never miss out on the news that matters to you!

      "title": "In his words: President Trump’s rhetoric about Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin has evolved",
      "description": "The road to a peace deal has been fraught with changing dynamics involving President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "content": "President Donald Trump repeatedly said during his White House campaign that if he won the 2024 election, he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in 24 hours.” But in the 10 months since he took office, the road to a peace deal has been fraught with changing dynamics involving the American leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump’s rhetoric toward both men has evolved. It continues to do so.At the outset of his second term in January, Trump was conciliatory toward Putin, for whom he long has shown admiration. Over time, Trump expressed increasing exasperation with Putin, while seemingly softening criticism of Zelenskyy after their February blowout in the Oval Office.Trump’s administration imposed sanctions on Russia and he was suggesting by the fall that Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia. That was a dramatic shift from his repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022.By late November, Trump had endorsed a peace plan favorable to Russia. Some Democratic senators suggested the proposal was a “wish list” that originated with Moscow and they had heard just that from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The State Department disputed it and Rubio insisted the plan was written by the United States. American allies in Europe nonetheless worried it was too conciliatory to Russia.Trump had returned to slamming Zelenskyy in ways that recalled how Trump and Vice President JD Vance had hounded the Ukrainian leader out of the Oval Office months earlier. Trump was now suggesting Zelenskyy was not appearing grateful enough for years of U.S. military support. The Republican president also chided European countries for not doing more to put economic pressure on Russa.Here is a look at what Trump has said this year and how his tone has changed:Jan. 31“We want to end that war. That war would have not started if I was president.”Trump said his new administration had already had “very serious” discussions with Russia and that he and Putin could soon take “significant” action toward ending the conflict.Feb. 19“A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”Trump’s harsh words for Zelenskyy on his Truth Social platform drew criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in Congress, where defending Ukraine from Russian aggression has traditionally had bipartisan support. Zelenskyy said Trump was falling into a Russian disinformation trap. He was quickly admonished by Vance about the perils of publicly criticizing the new U.S. president.Feb. 28“You’re gambling with World War III. And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”Trump and Vance berated Zelenskyy over the war, accusing him of not showing gratitude after he challenged Vance on the question of diplomacy with Putin. The argument in the Oval Office was broadcast globally. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy’s White House visit being canceled and called into question the U.S. support of Ukraine. A few days after the blowup, Trump temporarily paused military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskyy to seek peace.March 30“I don’t think he’s going to go back on his word. You’re talking about Putin. I don’t think he’s going to go back on his word. I’ve known him for a long time. We’ve always gotten along well.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he trusted Putin to hold up his end of a potential peace deal.April 24“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!”In a Truth Social post, Trump reacted to Russia attacking Kyiv with an hourslong barrage of missiles and drones. It was the first of his rare criticism of Putin as Russia stepped up its attacks on Ukraine.April 29“A lot of his people are dying. They’re being killed, and I feel very badly about it.”Trump addressed the toll on Ukrainians during an interview with ABC News after he met with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral. It was the first time the two leaders had met since the Oval Office spat and it signaled a shift in Trump’s attitude toward the Ukrainian president.May 25“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!”Trump’s Truth Social post made it clear he was losing patience with Putin as Moscow pounded Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles.June 25“He was very nice actually. We had a little rough times, sometimes. He was ... Couldn’t have been nicer. I think he’d like to see an end to this, I do.”Trump had a closed-door meeting with Zelenskyy during a NATO summit in The Hague. Trump’s comments to reporters later also opened the possibility of sending Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine.July 8“We get a lot of bull–—t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”Trump also said he was “not happy” with Putin and that the war was “killing a lot of people” on both sides. Trump’s comments during a Cabinet meeting came a day after he said the United States would send more weapons to Ukraine. It was a dramatic reversal after earlier announcing a pause in the delivery of previously approved firepower to Kyiv, a decision that was made amid concerns that America’s military stockpiles had declined too much.July 13“I am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said. He’ll talk so beautifully and then he’ll bomb people at night. We don’t like that.”Trump’s remarks to reporters came as Russia has intensified its aerial attacks.July 14“I don’t want to say he’s an assassin, but he’s a tough guy. It’s been proven over the years. He’s fooled a lot of people before.”Trump pushed harder against Putin during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Trump said if there was no deal to end the war within 50 days, the U.S. would impose “secondary tariffs,” meaning taxes would target Russia’s trading partners in an effort to isolate Moscow.Trump and Rutte also discussed a rejuvenated pipeline for U.S. weapons. European allies planned to buy military equipment and then transfer it to Ukraine.Aug. 15“There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”Trump failed to secure an agreement from Putin during a summit in Alaska even after rolling out the red carpet for the man who started the war.Trump had wanted to show off his deal-making skills. Instead, he handed Putin long-sought recognition on the international stage after years of Western efforts to make Putin a pariah over the war and his crackdown on dissent, and forestalled the threat of additional U.S. sanctions.Sept. 23“Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like ‘a paper tiger.’ ”Trump posted on social media soon after meeting with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders.He also said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia, a departure from Trump’s previous suggestions that Ukraine would never be able to reclaim all the territory that Russia has occupied since it seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.Oct. 17“Stop the war immediately.”After again hosting Zelenskyy at the White House, Trump implied that Moscow should be allowed keep territory it has taken from Kyiv if doing so could help end the conflict more quickly.“You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it’s too complicated,” Trump said. “You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.”Trump had a lengthy phone call with Putin the day before Zelenskyy arrived and announced he soon planned to meet with Putin in Hungary. That meeting never materialized, in part because of a lack of progress on ending the war.Trump also signaled to Zelenskyy that the U.S. would not be selling Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles, which the Ukrainians believed could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table.Oct. 22“Hopefully he’ll become reasonable.”Trump made the comment suggesting Putin could be more favorable to a peace agreement after the Treasury Department announced sanctions against Russia’s two biggest oil companies and their subsidiaries. But Trump added, “And, hopefully Zelenskyy will be reasonable, too. You know, it takes two to tango, as they say.”Nov. 21“He’s going to have to approve it.”Trump suggested that Zelenskyy would have to accept the U.S. peace plan. Trump pressed Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land to Moscow, a massive reduction in the size of Ukraine’s army and agreement from Europe to assert that Ukraine would never be admitted into the NATO military alliance.Trump set a Nov. 27 deadline — Thanksgiving Day in the U.S. — for Zelenskyy to respond to the plan. Trump also said more time could be allotted to Ukraine as long as progress was made to a lasting peace.Nov. 22“I would like to get to peace.”Asked if the peace plan was his final offer, Trump said it was not. He did not elaborate. But his comment suggested he would be willing to negotiate past the Nov. 27 deadline and alter the peace plan in ways that Ukraine wants. “We’re trying to get it ended. One way or the other, we have to get it ended,” Trump said of the war.Senators from both parties who have been critical of Trump’s approach to ending the war said they spoke with Rubio, who told them that the plan Trump was pushing Kyiv to accept was actually a “wish list” of the Russians.The State Department called that account “false” and Rubio later took the extraordinary step of insisting that the plan was U.S.-authored. But the incident raised still more questions about its ultimate fate.Nov. 23“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA.”In a post on his social media site, Trump went after Zelenskyy and the Europeans once more: “With strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “would have NEVER HAPPENED,” Trump said, again blaming his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for allowing the conflict in Ukraine.",

      "content": "Walmart and Amazon dominate American retail — and both want a piece of your grocery budget and gift-buying dollars. Their membership programs, Walmart+ and Amazon Prime, each promise to save you a bundle on everyday essentials, but they deliver value differently. Amazon Prime built its reputation on fast delivery and entertainment perks but charges extra for groceries. Walmart+ costs less (and just slashed its price to $49 for the holidays) while including grocery delivery, yet it can’t match Amazon’s massive product catalog. Choosing between Walmart+ or Amazon Prime comes down to one simple question: Which will you actually use? Here’s how these two giants compare on upfront costs, grocery delivery, prescription savings, fuel discounts and more so you can make an informed choice about where to spend your money. 🏷️ Price tag: A $41+ difference Let's start with the basics: what you'll actually pay for each membership. When you're on a fixed income or watching your budget, even small differences add up. Walmart+ undercuts Amazon Prime by about $41 – enough to cover a dinner out or several prescriptions. But right now, new Walmart+ members can grab their first year for just $49 , saving a whopping $90 over Prime. 🔍 Read more: 20+ clever money tricks frugal people swear by (that actually work!) 🛍️ Online shopping: Speed and selection When you need new shoes, a replacement phone charger or that book everyone's talking about, both memberships get it to your door fast. Amazon Prime pulls ahead on selection and speed. Need a specialty item or last-minute birthday gift shipped overnight? Amazon’s vast catalog gives you more options. Walmart+ covers everyday essentials — groceries, household goods, prescriptions — which covers most of your daily needs, but with a narrower selection overall. 🔍 Read more: Holiday shopping? Here's how much more you'll pay, thanks to tariffs 🛒 Grocery delivery: One's included, one costs extra Grocery shopping ranks high on most empty nesters' list of tedious errands — the parking, the crowds, the checkout lines. The difference is that Walmart+ includes grocery delivery in your base membership , while Amazon Prime makes you pay extra for it. Walmart+ includes free unlimited grocery delivery with your membership. Amazon Prime charges an extra $9.99 a month for its grocery delivery service — that's $120 more per year. For budget-conscious grocery shoppers, Walmart+ delivers better value. 🔍 Read more: 10 free apps dishing out real savings on groceries and restaurants 💊 Prescription savings: Which program saves more? Let’s talk about pharmacy benefits — something that becomes more and more important with each passing birthday. Amazon Prime’s RxPass wins if you take multiple generic medications. For a flat $5 a month, you get unlimited eligible prescriptions covering common conditions like high blood pressure and overactive bladder — savings that average up to 38% with free delivery. Only taking one or two generics? Walmart’s prescription program charging $4 for 30-day supplies or $10 for 90 day supplies beats RxPass — and you don’t need a membership to use it. 🔍 Read more: 6 simple ways to save money on your prescriptions (without skipping your meds) 🎥 Streaming perks: Movies, TV, music and more Both memberships throw in streaming and entertainment perks that could replace services you're already paying for, like Netflix or Hulu. Amazon Prime Video offers a massive number of shows and movies, plus access to more than 100 million songs, podcasts and games. Plus, Amazon throws in a free Grubhub+ membership — a savings of $120 a year. Walmart+ offers a simpler choice: a free subscription to either Paramount+ Essentials ( Yellowstone , NCIS ) or Peacock Premium ( Sunday Night Football, The Office ) — your choice, switchable every 90 days. 🔍 Read more: 12 everyday money drains — and free alternatives that actually work ⛽ Fuel savings: Where you’ll find the discounts Gas station stops add up fast, whether you're running errands or driving to see the grandkids.

And right now, you can get a year of Walmart+ for just $49 . It’s like getting 6 months free — but only through December 2. Prime makes sense if Amazon’s already your go-to for online shopping, its huge product catalog and entertainment extras might be worth the extra cost. Not sure? Both memberships offer a free 30-day trial. Test drive each one and track what you actually use — that’s the real test of value.

      "content": "S&P Global Ratings on Monday kept its projection for India’s economic expansion at 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal year and forecast 6.7 per cent for the following year, saying recent tax cuts and monetary policy easing are set to support consumption-led growth, PTI reported. The agency said these factors would play a central role in sustaining demand at a time when households benefit from both lower taxes and cheaper borrowing.Also Read: India’s Q2 growth forecast at 7.3% on rural show, higher govt capex“We anticipate that India’s GDP will grow by 6.5 per cent in fiscal year 2026 (ending March 2026) and 6.7 per cent in fiscal 2027, with risks evenly balanced. Domestic growth remains robust, driven by strong consumption, despite the impact of US tariffs,” S&P said in its Economic Outlook Asia-Pacific report.India’s real gross domestic product grew 7.8 per cent in the April to June quarter of the current fiscal year, which marked the fastest pace in five quarters. The official estimates for the July to September quarter are scheduled for release on November 28, and will offer a clearer sense of momentum heading into the second half of the year.A poll by ET of 12 economists shows expectations that India’s economic growth likely quickened to 7.3 per cent in the second quarter, supported by steady rural demand, higher government expenditure and early export shipments. Estimates in the poll ranged from 6.9 per cent to 7.7 per cent, with a median of 7.3 per cent. The National Statistical Office will release the official numbers on November 28, while the RBI has pegged growth for the September quarter at 7 per cent.Also Read: India's $10 trillion destiny will be decided by 4 DsThe Reserve Bank of India has projected growth of 6.8 per cent in the current fiscal, which is an improvement over last year’s expansion of 6.5 per cent. S&P said that if India can secure a trade agreement with the United States, it would reduce uncertainty and lift confidence, which would in turn help labour-intensive sectors that have been affected by shifts in global demand.“Lowered goods and service tax (GST) rates will support middle-class consumption and complement income tax cuts and interest rate reductions introduced this year. These changes are likely to make consumption a greater driver of growth compared with investment, in this fiscal year, and the next,” S&P added. The Government in the Budget for 2025-26 raised the income tax rebate threshold to ₹12 lakh from ₹7 lakh, offering relief of ₹1 lakh crore to the middle class. The RBI in June cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent, the lowest in three years. GST rates on about 375 items were reduced from September 22, making mass consumption goods cheaper.S&P said the higher effective US tariff on India is weighing on export-oriented manufacturing. However, there are signs the US may bring down tariffs on Indian goods. “The US’s new approach to trade policy is causing governments and firms to spend time and money on negotiating for exemptions, consequently diverting attention from efforts to raise productivity,” S&P added.",

      "description": "‘We will all die one day, but can we just stop living?' 'Join markets anyway, at least through a passive fund.’ ‘Everything is for the long haul.’ These, and more insights from Ramesh Damani, ace value stock picker.",
      "content": "Veteran value investor Ramesh Damani is ignoring doomsday warnings about a US tech stock correction and noises surrounding corporate earnings growth trajectory back home, staying loyal instead to his credo of long-term investments, using a bottom -up approach. He remains unconcerned about short term market corrections, advising investors to \"remain invested\" and benefit from the power of compounding. Damani notes that domestic liquidity is more than enough to absorb any selling from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). He believes that when FPIs return to the market, a ‘melt-up’ could occur, thanks to domestic buying. Edited excerpts from an interview. What are your takeaways from the earnings? What are you picking? Luckily, I don't look at broad macros like GDP, inflation etc. which impact earnings; I look at my stocks bottom-up, and I generally have a mixed bag. Some have reported very good earnings, or some have reported disappointing earnings, for whatever reason, may be because of rupee depreciation, or because of the US slowdown. But overall, the market seems okay. Liquidity is good; visibility is decent. So, on the whole, my advice to most people is to remain invested. There's obviously a lot of fear going on that the US markets are likely to fall, but that's been there for three years. I mean, we can't live our lives in fear all the time. We buy good companies, good businesses, and remain invested in them, which is what we're doing, right? You said there were some laggards and some outperformers. What's worked for you? I don't have any commodity-based companies, but some of the defence stocks did pretty well. I was happy with the numbers that came out. A couple of auto ancillary and engineering companies also did well. Some of the media stocks didn't do very well. I don't have as much exposure to IT stocks anymore. But overall, I expect good and bad numbers. I don't expect uniformly good numbers or bad numbers, because I'm putting more money through, you know. So, I'm willing to take a longer view than most people, and unlike most people, I don't sell when a bad quarter (earnings) comes. So, you're there for the long haul? Everything is for the long haul only. So, we don't really care. I mean, it's just three bad quarters, and then, as long as structural stories are intact, we are okay. From the macro point of view, do you feel interest rates and inflation are under control? Inflation is under control. Interest rates will probably come down. We worry about the global macro, you know, but that's all we worry about. I mean, I don't plan my life based on these fears. Some of the initial analyses suggested that we are not that bad off. Even after the US trade tariffs went to 50%, it hasn't pinched so far. Maybe down the line, we may feel the pain? Yes, it has largely impacted sectors such as jewellery and shrimp exports, many of which are absent from the listed space. So, what would your advice be for a retail investor—go through mutual funds or stock-pick? It's a bit more complicated than that. If you don't have time, invest in an index fund. You're busy running your own business, you're busy taking care of the kids, whatever, then that's what I suggest, for most people, go into passive funds. That's the best thing. If you don't have time and still want to be exposed to the markets, go into passive funds . But if you want to get rich, you'd better start picking stocks. That makes a huge difference between picking stocks and index funds over time. So, my job is to pick stocks. So, that's what—I won't tell anyone not to pick stocks, but if they don't have time, and they're busy running their own business or taking care of their family, at least be exposed to the market. How do you see the opportunities available in the primary market and the IPOs that come with the high valuations? I think there's enough liquidity. What happens is that anytime something goes up sharply, people talk about bubbles. It's not that easy to spot a bubble. When you're living in a bubble, you don't understand. It's only afterwards that you expect it. So it's fine. The market is absorbing. Some gain, and some lose. So, the primary market, the secondary market and the global markets are all okay. Am I worried? Yeah, I'm always worried. That's true in three years, even during covid, I was worried. But just because you're going to die doesn't mean you don't want to live. I mean, you still have to live every day. So, the same thing applies to the markets. We know all bull markets will end. And so will this one. So will the Dow at some point. But that doesn't mean you don't participate in it. I see no reasons or no signals that the markets have topped out. The market will give you signals that it has topped. I don't see that yet. There is concern that IPOs of new-age companies are issued at high multiples, and that some mutual funds are subscribing at those levels. People who say this are looking at the market in one dimension. Yes, it's a high P/E ratio. These are digital businesses. They can scale up very easily. Three years down the road, I guarantee they won't be that expensive as cash flows pick up. I won't look at the market in one dimension of a P/E ratio. That's one ratio. Look at the many other ratios, cash flow, opportunity, size... So, they're making that mistake. Mutual funds are basically smart money. I mean, they are answerable to the shareholders; if they perform poorly, they lose the money. So, we should stop being in a nanny state in India, saying we control everyone. It should be a free market, and that's the way it should prosper. What worries you at this stage? Everything worries me. Does the Dow worry me? Is AI in a bubble? Will it burst? Yeah, of course, it worries me. But is it going to burst imminently? It's not going to burst any time soon. So, the difference between 2002 and 2025, when you had the dotcom bubble, is that they were laying the optic fibre cables like there was no tomorrow. Those deploying the fibre knew that at that time, only 3-5% of the pipes would be lit. The rest will be dark fibre, which means overcapacity. We're nowhere near that level of overcapacity at this point, and the utilization of AI by almost everyone is increasing exponentially across business, education, and professional settings. So, they're nowhere near utilizing the full capacity of data centres , which is where the big capex is going. So, the party will continue. Obviously, I worry about all these things. As the adage goes, the ship is always safe in the harbour, but it's designed for the high seas. The same way, your money is always safe in a bank FD, and you won't lose any money. You'll make 8%, but inflation is 8% and what are you going to do? Do you want to get killed in life? You need to go out and put your money in good businesses. Like always. I'm not a great advocate of putting it in passive funds, because that's my job, capital allocation. But if you can find good stocks, I mean good businesses, you should put it in those. Are you worried about the currency weakening? Three and a half per cent annually is par for the course. We will always have it. They want that depreciation. Should we have a stronger currency? We should. But the tech boys will be up in arms, and the export boys will be up in arms. So, I don't believe we've reached that stage, that we will have an appreciating currency. Do you expect a rate cut? A 25 basis point cut this year. Inflation has gone down and GST is helping this. The impact of GST rationalization will also be felt in the December quarter, right? Are there any sectors that you're looking at which you don't have in your stocks, which are interesting to you at this point? If I knew, I would be buying them, but I don't know too many of them. I'm a bit underexposed in the new-age economy stocks, but they seem to have just run away. Sometimes, it doesn't work, but I would like to build some position into new-age stocks. Since you meet many FPIs sitting on a very large portion of equity assets, and you know that they are selling, what is the sense you get after speaking to them? Yeah, but it really doesn't bother me anymore. It used to be earlier. They used to be the most important number in the market, and now I barely look at it. Domestic liquidity is so strong, and I always tell people that for any volume of shares, there is a buyer and a seller. So they ( FPIs ) might be selling, but there is always a buyer. So, that's fine. So, if they come back into the Indian market at some point and the domestics are buying, there's going to be a melt-up. So, you know, it's because of the domestic liquidity. We've actually been well-buffered.",

      "content": "CHECK OUT: Share Your Feedback on Legit.ng & Win Access to Our Copywriting Course! Americans are expected to spend a record amount over the holiday season, despite lingering worries in the world's biggest economy about stubborn inflation, tariffs and the knock-on effects of the government shutdown. \"Consumers remain pretty concerned about inflation and, there's no doubt, about where prices are going,\" Mark Mathews, chief economist at the National Retail Federation (NRF), told reporters. For Mathews, the last time consumer confidence was so low -- apart from the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic -- dates back to the early 1980s. But, he added, \"over the past few years, we've seen consumers spend irrespective of how they're feeling about things.\" The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales -- from November 1 to December 31 -- to top $1 trillion for the first time, with growth of 3.7-4.2 percent as compared with last year. The record-setting 43-day government shutdown, which left hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and without a paycheck, triggered a decline in demand and in revenue for the private sector, but that situation is expected to quickly be reversed.

President Donald Trump's sweeping on-off tariffs however could affect demand for certain products, although experts say competition should temper the effects of tariffs on consumers' wallets. \"We're seeing a deliberate and aggressive approach to avoid passing price increases onto the consumers,\" said NRF president Matt Shay. Competition, especially in online deals, should help avert a massive hike in prices. For buyers, competitive prices and free delivery are two key factors, Vivek Pandya, an analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, told AFP. The share of sales made online should increase this holiday season to $253.4 billion dollars, up 5.3 percent over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. A record $5 billion is expected to be spent per day over the 10 days that begins on \"Black Friday\" and runs through \"Cyber Week.\" 'Restraint' For Pandya, a 5.3 percent increase in online sales is \"actually pretty good\" given the variables and challenges in the US economy.

But the big day will certainly be Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, which is the traditional launch of the holiday shopping season -- and also when the best deals are to be had. That is followed by Cyber Monday, when online shopping takes center stage, especially on electronics and other tech. For Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist at the Conference Board business research organization, US consumers are remaining \"cautious\" and may approach gift purchases with some \"restraint\" after years of inflation-related belt-tightening. The Conference Board's annual survey revealed that Americans will spend an average of $990 on holiday-related purchases this year, down 6.9 percent from 2024. When adjusted for inflation, the figures are well under pre-pandemic spending. \"Consumers also said they are focused on giving their family and friends items they need this year rather than items they want,\" Guichard said in a statement. More and more Americans are also turning to \"buy now, pay later\" options to spread out the spending over several months.

In October, traffic to US retail websites from generative-AI sources spiked 1,200 percent year-on-year, and those web users were 16 percent more likely to buy something, according to Adobe Analytics. \"This indicates that with AI tools, shoppers are becoming more informed and able to pinpoint the most relevant retailers for their needs,\" Adobe said. Another shopping trend is \"social commerce,\" or selling products directly to consumers on social media platforms, often via posts made by influencers. \"Social commerce is incredibly important\" this year, Pandya told AFP. \"People are spending a lot of time on their mobile devices, a lot of time on social media apps (...) and these influencers have become very effective at providing really strong discount codes and perks for their audiences to spend.\" Read also Trump tariff hikes hit US August imports, delayed data shows So what are the hot gift items for 2025? Experts say the new Nintendo Switch 2 game console and Apple's latest iPhone 17s will be popular, along with household appliances and home renovation items, as economic uncertainty means Americans are less likely to move.

      "description": "Wednesday's budget is going to big.",
      "content": "Wednesday's budget is going to big. It will be big in terms of tax rises, big in terms of setting the course of the economy and public services, and big in terms of political jeopardy for this government. The chancellor has a lot different groups to try to assuage and a lot at stake. \"There are lots of difference audiences to this budget,\" says one senior Labour figure. \"The markets will be watching, the public on the cost of living, the party on child poverty and business will want to like the direction in which we are travelling - from what I've seen so far, it's a pretty good package.\" The three core principles underpinning the chancellor's decisions will be to cut NHS waiting lists, cut national debt and cut the cost of living. There will be no return to austerity and no more increases in government borrowing. Politics Live: Reeves's 'mansplaining' claims are just a 'smokescreen', says shadow chancellor What flows from that is more investment in the NHS, already the big winner in the 2024 Budget, and tax rises to keep funding public services and help plug gaps in the government's finances. Some of these gaps are beyond Rachel Reeves' control, such as the decision by the independent fiscal watchdog (the Office for Budget Responsibility) to downgrade the UK's productivity forecasts - leaving the chancellor with a £20bn gap in the public finances - or the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs on the global economy. Others are self-inflicted, with the chancellor having to find about £7bn to plug her reversals on winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts. By not pulling the borrowing lever, she hopes to send a message to the markets about stability, and that should help keep down inflation and borrowing costs low, which in turn helps with the cost of living, because inflation and interest rates feed into what we pay for food, for energy, rent and mortgage costs. That's what the government is trying to do, but what about the reality when this budget hits? This is going to be another big Labour budget, where people will be taxed more and the government will spend more. Only a year ago the chancellor raised a whopping £40bn in taxes and said she wasn't coming back for more. Now she's looking to raise more than £30bn. That the prime minister refused to recommit to his manifesto promise not to raise income tax, VAT or national insurance on working at the G20 in South Africa days ahead of the budget is instructive: this week we could see the government announce manifesto-breaking tax rises that will leave millions paying more. Freeze to income thresholds expected The biggest tax lever, raising income tax rates, was going to be pulled but has now been put back in neutral after the official forecasts came in slightly better than expected, and Downing Street thought again about being the first government in 50 years to raise the income tax rate. On the one hand, this measure would have been a very clean and clear way of raising £20bn of tax. On the other, there was a view from some in government that the PM and his chancellor would never recover from such a clear breach of trust, with a fair few MPs comparing it to the tuition fees U-turn that torpedoed Nick Clegg's Lib Dems in the 2015 General Election. Instead, the biggest revenue in the budget will be another two-year freeze on income tax thresholds until 2030. This is the very thing that Reeves promised she would not do at the last budget in 2024 because \"freezing the thresholds will hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\". This week those words will come back to haunt the chancellor. Two-child cap big headline grabber There will also be more spending and the biggest headline grabber will be the decision to lift the two-child benefit cap. This was something the PM refused to commit to in the Labour manifesto, because it was one of the things he said he couldn't afford to do if he wanted to keep taxes low for working people. But on Wednesday, the government will announce its spending £3bn-a-year to lift that cap. Labour MPs will like it, polling suggests the public will not. What we are going to get on Wednesday is another big tax and spend Labour budget on top of the last. For the Conservatives, it draws clear dividing lines to take Labour on. They will argue that this is the \"same old Labour\", taxing more to spend more, and more with no cuts to public spending. Having retreated on welfare savings in the summer, to then add more to the welfare bill by lifting the two-child cap is a gift for Labour's opponents and they will hammer the party on the size of the benefits bill, where the cost of support people with long-term health conditions is set to rise from £65bn-a-year to a staggering £100bn by 2029-30. Mansion tax on the cards There is also a real risk of blow-up in this budget as the chancellor unveils a raft of revenue measures to find that £30bn. There could be a mansion tax for those living in more expensive homes, a gambling tax, a tourism tax, a milkshake tax. Ministers are fearful that one of these more modest revenue-raising measures becomes politically massive and blows up. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 This is what happened to George Osborne in 2012 when he announced plans to put 20% of VAT on hot food sold in bakeries and supermarkets. The plan quickly became an attack on the working man's lunch from out-of-touch Tories and the \"pasty tax\" was ditched two months later. And what about the voters? Big tax and spend budgets are the opposite of what Sir Keir Starmer promised the country when he was seeking election. His administration was not going to be another Labour tax and spend government but instead invest in infrastructure to turbocharge growth to help pay for better services and improve people's everyday lives. Seventeen months in, the government doesn't seem to be doing things differently. A year ago, it embarked on the biggest tax-raising budget in a generation, and this week, it goes back on its word and lifts taxes for working people. It creates a big trust deficit. Government attempts to tell a better story There are those in Labour who will read this and point to worse-than-expected government finances, global headwinds and the productivity downgrades as reasons for tax raising. But it is true too that economists had argued in the run-up to the election that Labour's position on not cutting spending or raising taxes was unsustainable when you looked at the public finances. Labour took a gamble by saying tax rises were not needed before the election and another one when the chancellor said last year she was not coming back for more. After a year-and-a-half of governing, the country isn't feeling better off, the cost of living isn't easing, the economy isn't firing, the small boats haven't been stopped, and the junior doctors are again on strike. Read more: Reeves hints at more welfare cuts Reeves vows to 'grip the cost of living' What tax rises could chancellor announce? The PM told me at the G7 summit in Canada in June that one of his regrets of his first year wasn't \"we haven't always told our story as well as we should\". What you will hear this week is the government trying to better tell that story about what it has achieved to improve people's lives - be that school breakfast clubs or extending free childcare, increasing the national living wage, giving millions of public sector workers above-inflation pay rises. You will also hear more about the NHS, as the waiting lists for people in need of non-urgent care within 18 weeks remain stubbornly high. It stood at 7.6m in July 2024 and was at 7.4m at the end of September. The government will talk on Wednesday about how it intends to drive those waits down. But there is another story from the last 18 months too: Labour said the last budget was a \"once in a parliament\" tax-raising moment, now it's coming back for more. Labour said in the election it would protect working people and couldn't afford to lift the two child-benefit cap, and this week could see both those promises broken. Can PM convince his MPs? Labour flip-flopped on winter fuel allowance and on benefit cuts, and is now raising your taxes. Downing Street has been in a constant state of flux as the PM keeps changing his top team, the deputy prime minister had to resign for underpaying her tax, while the UK's ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, was sacked over his ties to the Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted paedophile. It doesn't seem much like politics being done differently. All of the above is why this budget is big. Because Wednesday is not just about the tax and spend measures, big as they may be. It is also about this government, this prime minister, this chancellor. Starmer said ahead of this budget that he was \"optimistic\" and \"if we get this right, our country has a great future\". But he has some serious convincing to do. Many of his own MPs and those millions of people who voted Labour in, have lost confidence in their ability to deliver, which is why the drumbeat of leadership change now bangs. Going into Wednesday, it's difficult to imagine how this second tax-raising budget will lessen that noise around a leader and a Labour government that, at the moment, is fighting to survive.",

      "content": "UBS Research has initiated coverage on Shaily Engineering Plastics with a Buy rating and a price target of Rs 4,000, implying 60% upside potential. The brokerage assigns a 45x PE on the FY27–28 estimated EPS average—a premium to the three-year average of 28x but below the peak multiple of 60x. In today’s trading session, the stock is up 2.9% at Rs 2,550. Over the past year, the stock has already delivered multibagger returns, rallying 131%. Shaily, a precision plastics engineering company, serves the healthcare, personal care, electronics, and industrial segments. It is among a few firms with patented technology for fixed-dose and auto-injector pens, positioning it for the upcoming launch of generic GLP-1 (semaglutide). UBS believes the market is underestimating Shaily’s growth potential and operational capabilities. The company is expected to see increased traction and higher utilisation in its consumer and industrial segments, where it serves global clients including IKEA, GE Appliances, P&G, and Schaeffler. Shaily could also benefit from a favourable India–US trade deal and tariff reductions, while a potential large customer win in the consumer electronics and semiconductor space offers additional optionality. UBS forecasts a 75% EPS CAGR between FY25–28. Healthcare Segment Set for Strong Growth with GLP-1 Launch: The patent for GLP-1 (semaglutide) is set to expire in 2026 in key markets such as India, Canada, and Brazil, with a total addressable market of 550–600 million devices, translating to Rs 80–85 billion in revenue by 2030. UBS’s scenario analysis projects an EBITDA CAGR of ~39% in a low-case scenario, while base/high-case projections range between 52% and 59% CAGR for FY25–30E. Shaily has tied up with 23–24 global pharma companies for generic GLP-1, potentially capturing a 50–60% market share in these regions. High entry barriers, patented technology, and complex regulatory requirements are expected to protect Shaily’s market position. UBS projects the healthcare segment revenue CAGR at ~96% (FY25–28), with contribution rising from 21% to 55% of total revenues. Consumer and Industrial Segments to Grow Steadily: Shaily supplies global leaders like IKEA, Gillette, P&G, GE Appliances, and Schaeffler with plastic and metal components for domestic and export markets. While recent segment weakness is attributed to unfavourable tariffs, potential tariff reductions from trade deals could boost competitiveness. UBS forecasts ~18% revenue CAGR in these segments between FY25–28, with improving margins and ROCE supported by underutilised capacity. On the technical front, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the stock is currently at 49.9. Typically, an RSI below 30 indicates that a stock is oversold, suggesting a potential buying opportunity, while an RSI above 70 signals that it is overbought, which could indicate a potential correction.
